## Managing dependencies

### Poetry

To guarantee repeatable installations, all project dependencies are managed using [Poetry](https://poetry.eustace.io/). The project’s direct dependencies are listed in `pyproject.toml`.
Running `poetry lock` generates `poetry.lock` which has all versions pinned.

You can install Poetry by using `pip install --pre poetry` or by following the official installation guide [here](https://github.com/sdispater/poetry#installation).
We recommend using at least version `1.0.0b` as it contains many fixes and features that Saleor relies on.

:::tip
We recommend that you use this workflow and keep `pyproject.toml` as well as `poetry.lock` under version control to make sure all computers and environments run exactly the same code.

### Other tools

For compatibility, Saleor also provides `requirements.txt` and `requirements_dev.txt`.

These files should be updated by running `poetry export --without-hashes -f requirements.txt -o requirements.txt` and `poetry export --without-hashes -f requirements.txt -o requirements_dev.txt --dev`, respectively.

## Coding style

Saleor uses various tools to maintain a common coding style and help with development.
To install all the development tools, run the following commands:

```shell
python -m pip install -r requirements_dev.txt
```

or use `poetry`:

```shell
poetry install
```

Saleor uses the [pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com/#install) tool to check and automatically fix any formatting issue before creating a git commit.

Run the following command to install pre-commit into your git hooks and have it run on every commit:

```shell
pre-commit install
```

For more information on how it works, see the `.pre-commit-config.yaml` configuration file.

Saleor has a strict formatting policy enforced by the [black formatting tool](https://github.com/python/black).

Module names should make their purpose obvious. Avoid generic file names such as `utils.py`.

### Linters

Use [black](https://github.com/python/black/) to make sure your code is correctly formatted.

Use [isort](https://github.com/timothycrosley/isort) to maintain consistent imports.

Use [pylint](https://www.pylint.org/) with the `pylint-django` plugin to catch errors in your code.

Use [pycodestyle](http://pycodestyle.pycqa.org/en/latest/) to make sure your code adheres to PEP 8.

Use [pydocstyle](http://pydocstyle.pycqa.org/en/latest/) to check that your docstrings are properly formatted.

## EditorConfig

[EditorConfig](http://editorconfig.org/) is a standard configuration file that aims to ensure consistent style across multiple programming environments.

Saleor’s repository contains [an `.editorconfig` file](https://github.com/mirumee/saleor/blob/master/.editorconfig) describing our formatting requirements.

Most editors and IDEs support this file either directly or via plugins. See the [list of supported editors and IDEs](http://editorconfig.org/#download) for detailed instructions.

If you make sure that your programming environment respects the contents of this file, you will automatically get correct indentation, encoding, and line endings.

## Git commit messages

To speed up the review process and to keep the logs tidy, we recommend the following simple rules on how to write good commit messages:

### Summary line

- It should contain less than 50 characters. It is best to make it short
- Introduce what has changed, using imperatives: fix, add, modify, etc.

### Description

- Add extra explanation if you feel it will help others to understand the summary content
- If you want, use bullet points (each bullet beginning with a hyphen or an asterisk)
- Avoid writing in one line. Use line breaks so the reader does not have to scroll horizontally

:::tip
To ease review, try to limit your commits to a single, self-contained issue. This will also help others to understand and manage them in the future.
