title: Events
---

## Key concepts

Events are auto-generated and are triggered when certain actions are completed; for example, creating an order, cancelling fulfillment or completing a payment.

## Architecture

Each package representing an entity (order, account, etc.) that generates events defines both a model and an `events.py` file containing a set of functions with an `_event` as a suffix.

Those functions take care of any logic and the required fields for creating given events.

## Creating events

To send an event, run the following code:

```python
from saleor.order import events

# returns an OrderEvent
events.note_added_event(order=order, user=user, message="hello world!")
```

If you want to send a _sent email_ event, run the following code:

```python
from saleor.order import events

events.email_sent_event(
    order=order,
    user=user,
    email_type=events.OrderEventsEmails.TRACKING_UPDATED,
)
```

Take note of the way the email type is provided.

:::note
The methods are using a `model_action_event` naming pattern.
