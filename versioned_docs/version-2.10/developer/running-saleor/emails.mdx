title: Customizing Emails
---

Templates for emails are located in `templates/templated_email`. App-specific directories contain `*.email` files which define each specific message type.

The `source` directory contains [MJML](https://mjml.io/) templates. Those `.mjml` files need to be compiled to HTML and put into the `compiled` directory before they can be used. Emails defined in `.email` files include their HTML versions by explicitly including a compiled `.html` file.

To compile the emails you need to have Node.js 10.x or later installed. See the [Node.js installation instructions](https://nodejs.org/en/download/package-manager/) for instructions.

You also need to install Saleor's frontend dependencies first. To do that run:

```shell
npm install
```

To compile the emails run:

```shell
npm run build-emails
```
