## Introduction

By default, Saleor handles several aspects of the regulations introduced by the GDPR.


## Deleting users

A user account can be deleted from the dashboard level by a staff user. This action is processed immediately.

Users are also able to request their account to be deleted, from the storefront level, on their user profile settings. In such case, a confirmation email is sent to the email address associated with the account.

:::note
Deleting a user removes their account instance. All data used for the checkout process are left untouched. This is to keep track of financial transaction. 

This solution follows the GDPR regulations.
