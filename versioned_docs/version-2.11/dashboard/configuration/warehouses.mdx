## Introduction

This page presents an overview of managing your multi-warehouse inventory. In short, a multi-warehouse feature is the ability to split inventory among multiple locations. Saleor 2.10 supports the implementation of basic multi-warehouse management. This will enable the platform to more closely follow your existing stock management process.

## Creating a warehouse

To create a warehouse, visit the _Warehouses_ section in the _Configuration_ tab.
