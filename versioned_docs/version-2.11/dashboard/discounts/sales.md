## Using sales in Saleor

Sales are an excellent way to encourage customers to use your store. Saleor offers you a range of sale options:

- Specific price reductions or percentage discounts
- Sales on single or grouped products, categories, and collections
- Flexible time periods for sales events, which can be deactivated and reactivated at any time.


## How to create a sale

### Step 1: Add a new sale

Click _Create&nbsp;Sale_ above the main sales list and fill in the relevant sections.

### Step 2: General Information card

Add the name of your sale. This can be edited later.


### Step 3: Pricing

**Discount Value:** Use the icon on the right side of the Discount Value field to toggle between percentage discount and price-per-item discount.

**Time Frame:** Use the pop-up calendar or stepper to choose the start and end dates of the sale. If you do not set a start date, the sale will start immediately; similarly, a sale without an end date will continue indefinitely.


### Step 4: Summary

Once you have set the basic parameters of your sale and saved them, the summary section on the right side of the page will show an overview of the event.


### Step 5: Assign categories, collections, or products

Select the items in your sale. The categories section allows you to select individual products, assign entire categories, or assign entire pre-created collections.

Click _Save_ on the footer bar to save the sale.
