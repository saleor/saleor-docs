Saleor consists of three distinctive components:

1. First is the **Saleor Core** which is the backend server that exposes the GraphQL API. The core is written in Python and does not have a user interface of its own. It maintains its state in a PostgreSQL database and caches some information in Redis where available.

2. Then there's **Saleor Dashboard** which implements the user interface that staff members can use to operate a store. The dashboard is a React application that runs in the browser and talks to the core server. It's a static website so it does not have any backend code of its own.

3. Lastly there's **Saleor Storefront** which is an example storefront implemented in React. You can customize its code to suit your needs or you can build a custom storefront using the underlying **Saleor SDK**.

All three components communicate using GraphQL over HTTPS.
