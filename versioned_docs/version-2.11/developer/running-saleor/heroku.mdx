## Saleor Deployment
To deploy Saleor to Heroku create a new Heroku app and configure your Saleor's git repository together with Heroku app using:

```shell
heroku git:remote -a '<saleor-app name>'
heroku buildpacks:set heroku/nodejs
heroku buildpacks:add heroku/python
heroku addons:create heroku-postgresql:hobby-dev
heroku addons:create heroku-redis:hobby-dev
heroku addons:create sendgrid:starter
heroku config:set ALLOWED_HOSTS='<your hosts here>'
heroku config:set NODE_MODULES_CACHE=false
heroku config:set NPM_CONFIG_PRODUCTION=false
heroku config:set SECRET_KEY='<your secret key here>'
```
*ALLOWED_HOSTS* are required to properly setup CORS headers.
*SECRET_KEY* is used by Django to store your secret data, it should have a cryptographically strong amount of entropy in case of production deployments.

In the next step, deploy using
```
git push heroku master
```
Heroku will build and deploy Saleor automatically.

:::note
Heroku’s storage is volatile. This means that all instances of your application have separate disks and lose all changes made to the local disk each time the application is restarted. The best approach is to use cloud storage such as Amazon S3. See [Storing Files on Amazon S3](s3) for configuration details.

### Populating the database with example data
Before logging in to Saleor Dashboard, you need to create a staff / superuser account. To do that, please run the following command: 
```
heroku run -a '<saleor-app name>' python manage.py createsuperuser
```
Also, if you want to populate the database with sample data, run the following command: 
```
heroku run -a '<saleor-app name>' python manage.py populatedb --createsuperuser
```
:::note
The command `heroku run -a '<saleor-app name>' python manage.py populatedb --createsuperuser` will fill the database with sample data. It is NOT supposed to be executed in a production environment!
:::
Both commands create an admin account with the email: `admin@example.com` and password: `admin`

## Storefront and Dashboard Deployment
Deployment of both Saleor Storefront and Dashboard require exactly the same steps. First, create new Heroku apps for both services. Then configure both of them and your Storefront and Dashboard git repository using:
```
heroku git:remote -a '<Heroku-app name>'
heroku buildpacks:set mars/create-react-app
heroku config:set NODE_MODULES_CACHE=false
heroku config:set NPM_CONFIG_PRODUCTION=false
heroku config:set API_URI='<URL to your Saleor instance>/graphql/'
```
The next step is just to deploy using
```
git push heroku master
```

### How to log in to Saleor Dashboard

Once the Saleor Dashboard app has been created on Heroku, you can log in via the URL `<dashboard-app name>.herokuapp.com` using the admin account.

## Updating currency exchange rates

You should run this command periodically. The best way to ensure this is done is by using Heroku’s Scheduler service. 

To add it to our application:

```shell
heroku addons:create scheduler
```

Then log into your Heroku account, find the Heroku Scheduler add-on in the active add-on list, and have it run the following command on a daily basis:

```shell
python manage.py update_exchange_rates --all
```
