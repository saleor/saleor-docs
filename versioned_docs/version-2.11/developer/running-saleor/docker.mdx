Saleor's preferred deployment method is using Docker.

## Core

To build the image, use `docker build`:

```shell
cd saleor
docker build -t <yourimagename> .
```

The image is suitable for production use. See the [Configuration](configuration.mdx) for a list of environment variables you can use to configure the container.

## Dashboard and storefront

The dashboard and the storefront are static applications that do not require additional servers.

You can deploy them using Docker but consider using a dedicated static hosting platform like Amazon S3 and CloudFront, or Vercel (ZEIT Now) instead.
