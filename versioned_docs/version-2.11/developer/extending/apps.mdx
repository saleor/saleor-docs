## Key Concepts

### Architecture

Saleor Apps are separate applications that use GraphQL to talk to a Saleor server and that can receive webhooks with event notifications from Saleor.

### Authentication

Unlike regular users, Saleor Apps use a bearer token. The token is assigned at App installation time and needs to be stored in a secure manner.

The authorization header for Apps has the following format:

```http
Authorization: Bearer <app-token>
```

### The App manifest

The App manifest is a JSON file that describes the application, including its name, version, required permissions, and how it handles the store's data.

Saleor expects the manifest to use the following format:

```json
{
  "id": "example.app.wonderful",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "name": "My Wonderful App",
  "about": "My Wonderful App is a wonderful App for Saleor.",

  "permissions": ["MANAGE_USERS", "MANAGE_STAFF"],

  "appUrl": "http://localhost:3000/app",
  "configurationUrl": "htpp://localhost:3000/configuration",
  "tokenTargetUrl": "http://localhost:3000/register",

  "dataPrivacy": "Lorem ipsum",
  "dataPrivacyUrl": "http://localhost:3000/app-data-privacy",
  "homepageUrl": "http://localhost:3000/homepage",
  "supportUrl": "http://localhost:3000/support"
}
```
:::note
During an installation of third-party App, Saleor will try to send an authentication token to provided `tokenTargetUrl`.

### Webhooks

Webhooks can be used to receive data from Saleor when particular events happen. The available events are:

| Name                        | Description                                                                                                                      |
| --------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `ANY_EVENTS`                | Receive webhooks when any of the available events is triggered (wildcard event).                                                 |
| `CHECKOUT_CREATED`          | A new checkout is created.                                                                                          |

| `CUSTOMER_CREATED`          | A new customer account is created.                                                                                               |
| `ORDER_CREATED`             | A new order is placed.                                                                                                           |
| `ORDER_FULLY_PAID`          | Payment is made and an order is fully paid.                                                                                      |

#### Webhook protocols

Webhooks support below protocols:

- HTTP(S) 
- Google Cloud Pub/Sub
- AWS SQS

##### HTTP(S)

Webhook payloads are sent in POST requests.

All webhooks with `targetUrl`, where the scheme is HTTP(S) will use this protocol.

Saleor calculates the HMAC sha256 header - `X-Saleor-Signature` based on `secretKey` and the payload


##### Google Cloud Pub/Sub

All webhooks where scheme is `gcpubsub` will be treated as a Google Cloud Pub/Sub webhooks.
The structure of `targetUrl` should be as below:
```
gcpubsub://cloud.google.com/projects/<yourproject>/topics/<yourtopic>
```

To proper use the Google Cloud Pub/Sub you need to set the [`GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS` environment variable](https://cloud.google.com/pubsub/docs/quickstart-client-libraries) 


##### AWS SQS

All webhooks where scheme is `awssqs` will be treated as AWS SQS webhooks.

The structure of `targetUrl` should be as below:
```
awssqs://<access_key_id>:<secret_access_key>@sqs.<region>.amazonaws.com/<account_id>/<queue_name>
```


### Type of Apps
- `local`: create a custom App instance, assign explicitly provided permissions. 
The app is fully manageable from dashboard. You can change assigned permissions, add webhooks, or authentication token. 
`local` app can be useful for creating integration with some services which will parse the webhook payload.  
:::note
If you're building a single service dedicated only to your shop this solution will handle all your needs.
:::

- `third-party`: install App in Saleor and proceed with all required steps to prepare the communication channel for App.  
Installation is fully automated.  Saleor uses a defined App manifest to gather all required information.  
If there are no errors during the installation, App gets the possibility to attach to Saleor Dashboard over the iframe, 
communicate with Saleor over API and use webhooks to subscribe for the given events.
:::note
If you're building an App that will be published in the marketplace, then this solution is dedicated to you. 
:::

## Creating and installing Apps from the command line

Saleor provides commands that can be used to create/install an App from the command line.

### Creating local Apps

To create a local App with explicitly provided permissions use the `create_app` command.


Arguments:

- `<name>`: the name of the App, required.
- `--permission <PERM>`: assign permission `PERM` to the App. This argument can be repeated to specify multiple permissions.
- `--activate`: immediately activate the new App.
- `--target-url <URL>`: URL to send the API auth token to once installation is complete. [Optional]

> **Example:** The following command will create an App named "Order App" that can access users and orders:
>
> ```shell
> python manage.py create_app "Order App" \
>    --permission MANAGE_USERS \
>    --permission MANAGE_ORDERS \
>    --target_url https://your-order-app/your-register-endpoint/
> ```


If the target URL is provided, Saleor will POST the API auth token, in the same JSON format, to the provided URL:

<Chart
  definition={`
  sequenceDiagram
    Saleor ->> App: POST /token/target/url/<br>{"auth_token": "new-app-token"}
    App -->> Saleor: HTTP 200 OK
`}
/>


If the target URL is not specified, the command will output an API auth token in the following format:

```shell
{"auth_token": "new-app-token"}
```

### Installing third-party Apps

To install a `third-party` App based on its manifest URL use the `install_app` command.

Arguments:

- `<manifest URL>`: URL of the manifest file, required.
- `--activate`: immediately activate the new App.


> **Example:** The following command will download given manifest and install the app:
>
> ```shell
> python manage.py install_app https://www.url.to.manifest
> ```


App installation is confirmed by sending an API token to the specified token target URL.

## The GraphQL API

### Third-party Apps
#### Installing an App

Installing an App with `appInstall` mutation creates an App based on its manifest URL. 

This mutation is only available to staff users with the `MANAGE_APPS` permission. Staff user can't grant app more permissions than he has for his own.

The mutation takes the following input fields:
- `appName`: the name of the App, required.
- `manifestUrl`: URL of the manifest file, required.
- `permissions`: list of permissions the app should be granted.
- `activateAfterInstallation`: immediately activate the new App. Default true.

The response of the mutation contains the `appInstallation` which contains all information about installation process.

```graphql {2-8}
mutation{
  appInstall(
      input: {
        appName: "External Order App", 
        manifestUrl: "http://localhost:3000/manifest", 
        permissions:[MANAGE_ORDERS]
      }
  ) {
    appInstallation{
      id
      status
      appName
      manifestUrl
    }
    appErrors{
      field
      message
      code
      permissions
    }
  }
}
```
If there are no errors in the response, a new app installation process is created:

```json
{
  "data": {
    "appInstall": {
      "appInstallation": {
        "id": "QXBwT25nb2luZ0luc3RhbGxhdGlvbjoz",
        "status": "PENDING",
        "appName": "Order App",
        "manifestUrl": "http://localhost:3000/manifest"
      },
      "appErrors": []
    }
  }
}
```

The chart below explains workflow of the installation process:

##### Schedule installation

<Chart

    Client ->>+ Saleor: mutation appInstall
    Saleor ->> Saleor: Validate recieved data
    Saleor ->>+ Background Worker: Schedule installation
    Background Worker -->>- Saleor: Scheduled
    Saleor -->>- Client: return appInstallation
`}
/>

##### Install an App

<Chart

    Saleor ->>+ App: POST /token/target/url/<br>{"auth_token": "new-app-token"}
    App -->>- Saleor: HTTP 200 OK
`}
/>

#### Retrieving ongoing installations

To fetch all ongoing and failed installations, use the `appsInstallations` query. 
This query is only available to staff users with the `MANAGE_APPS` permission. 
The query returns list of `AppInstallation` objects.

```graphql {2}
{
  appsInstallations{
    id
    status
    appName
  }
}
```
The query returns a similar response:
```json
{
  "data": {
    "appsInstallations": [
      {
        "id": "QXBwT25nb2luZ0luc3RhbGxhdGlvbjoy",
        "status": "FAILED",
        "appName": "Shipping App"
      },
      {
        "id": "QXBwT25nb2luZ0luc3RhbGxhdGlvbjoz",
        "status": "PENDING",
        "appName": "Order App"
      }
    ]
  }
}
```
#### Retrying failed installation

If the `appsInstallations` query returns App with failed status, there is a possibility to retry the installation process. 
This mutation is only available to staff users with the `MANAGE_APPS` permission. 
Staff user can't retry app installation if app requires more permissions than he has for his own.
The `appRetryInstall` mutation will run the installation process for a given app.

The mutation takes the following fields:
- `id`: the id of the `AppInstallation`, required.
- `activateAfterInstallation`: immediately activate the new App. Default true.

Example of retrying installation of app with id `QXBwT25nb2luZ0luc3RhbGxhdGlvbjoy`:
```graphql {2}
 mutation{
  appRetryInstall(id:"QXBwT25nb2luZ0luc3RhbGxhdGlvbjoy"){
    appErrors{
      field
      message
      code
    }
    appInstallation{
      id
      status
    }
  }
}
```

#### Deleting failed installation
If the `appsInstallations` query returns App with failed status, there is a possibility to delete failed installation. 
This mutation is only available to staff users with the `MANAGE_APPS` permission.
The `appDeleteFailedInstallation` mutation will delete failed installation.

The mutation takes the following fields:
- `id`: the id of the `AppInstallation`, required.



### Local Apps


#### Creating an App

To create a new app, use the `appCreate` mutation. This mutation is only available to staff users with the `MANAGE_APPS` permission. Staff user can't grant app more permissions than he has for his own. The mutation takes the following input fields:

- `name`: the name of the app.
- `isActive`: whether to activate the app, defaults to `true`.
- `permissions`: list of permissions the app should be granted.

Let's assume that we want to create an order processing service that can fetch and manage orders in Saleor. To do so, we create a new app with the `MANAGE_ORDERS` permission:

```graphql {2-4}
mutation {
  appCreate(
    input: { name: "Order processing service", permissions: [MANAGE_ORDERS] }
  ) {
    authToken
    app {
      id
      name
    }
    appErrors {
      field
      code
    }
  }
}
```

If there are no errors in the response, a new app is created:

```json
{
  "data": {
    "appCreate": {
      "authToken": "Es1O0oB2O3PTeG9A4IVYUcaMoru3Ls",
      "app": {
        "id": "QXBwOjk=",
        "name": "Order processing service"
      },
      "appErrors": []
    }
  }
}
```

The response contains the `authToken` field - this is the token that the app needs to include in requests to Saleor API to authorize itself and have access to queries or mutations that it needs.

:::note
The `authToken` field is only available in the mutation response and cannot be fetched later, except for the last four digits.
:::

#### Creating authorization keys

Creating an app with `appCreate` mutation creates the default authorization token (`authToken`). You can create more authorization keys with the `appTokenCreate`. The mutation takes the following fields:

- `app`: ID of the app.
- `name`: (optional) name of the key.

```graphql {2}
mutation {
  appTokenCreate(input: { app: "QXBwOjk=" }) {
    authToken
    appErrors {
      field
      code
    }
    appToken {
      id
    }
  }
}
```

#### Revoking authorization keys

To revoke an authorization key, use the `appTokenDelete`:

```graphql {2}
mutation {
  appTokenDelete(id: "QXBwOjk=") {
    appErrors {
      field
      code
  }
}
```

### Retrieving all Apps

To fetch list of all apps, use `apps` query. This query is only available to staff users with the `MANAGE_APPS` permission.

```graphql {2}
{
  apps(first: 5){
    edges{
      node{
        id
        permissions{
          code
        }
        name
        isActive
        webhooks{
          name
        }
        
      }
    }
  }
}
```


The query returns a similar response:
```json
{
  "data": {
    "apps": {
      "edges": [
        {
          "node": {
            "id": "QXBwOjE=",
            "permissions": [
              {
                "code": "MANAGE_ORDERS"
              }
            ],
            "name": "Order App",
            "isActive": true,
            "webhooks": []
          }
        }
      ]
    }
  }
}
```


### Activating an App
To activate an app, use the `appActivate` mutation. This mutation is only available to staff users with the `MANAGE_APPS` permission. 
Staff user can't activate app which has more permissions than he has for his own. 

The mutation takes the following fields:
- `id`: the id of the `App`, required.

```graphql {2}
mutation {
  appActivate(id:"QXBwOjE="){
    app{
      id
      isActive
    }
    appErrors{
      field
      message
      code
    }
  }
}
```

The query returns a similar response:
```json
{
  "data": {
    "appActivate": {
      "app": {
        "id": "QXBwOjE=",
        "isActive": true
      },
      "appErrors": []
    }
  }
}
```
### Deactivating an App

To deactivate an app, use the `appDeactivate` mutation. This mutation is only available to staff users with the `MANAGE_APPS` permission. 
Staff user can't deactivate an app which has more permissions than they have for their own. 

:::note
Deactivating an app will disable all auth-tokens generated for an app. 
The app won't receive a webhook payload.
:::

The mutation takes the following fields:
- `id`: the id of the `App`, required.

```graphql {2}
mutation {
  appDeactivate(id:"QXBwOjE="){
    app{
      id
      isActive
    }
    appErrors{
      field
      message
      code
    }
  }
}
```


The query returns a similar response:
```json
{
  "data": {
    "appDeactivate": {
      "app": {
        "id": "QXBwOjE=",
        "isActive": false
      },
      "appErrors": []
    }
  }
}
```

### Subscribing to a webhook

To subscribe to a webhook, we need to first create an app with proper permissions. Let's assume that we want to extend the order processing app that we've created in the example above. The app should receive notifications whenever new orders are created in Saleor. To do so, we'll create a new webhook using the `webhookCreate` mutation. The mutation takes the following input:

- `name`: name of the webhook.
- `targetUrl`: URL of a service that will receive webhooks requests.
- `events`: list of the events to subscribe to.
- `app`: ID of the app to which the webhook belongs.
- `isActive`: whether to activate the webhook.

```graphql {2-10}
mutation {
  webhookCreate(
    input: {
      name: "New orders notification"
      targetUrl: "https://order-processing-service.example.com"
      events: [ORDER_CREATED]
      app: "QXBwOjk="
      isActive: true
      secretKey: "secret-key"
    }
  ) {
    webhook {
      id
    }
    webhookErrors {
      field
      code
    }
  }
}
```

If there are no errors in the response, the webhook is successfully created. From now on, whenever a new order is placed, payload with order data will be sent to your `targetUrl`.

### Updating a webhook

To update a webhook (e.g. to deactivate it or change the permissions), use the `webhookUpdate` mutation. The mutation takes similar input fields as the `webhookCreate` mutation. The example below shows how to deactive a webhook:

```graphql {2}
mutation {
  webhookUpdate(id: "V2ViaG9vazox", input: { isActive: false }) {
    webhook {
      isActive
    }
    webhookErrors {
      field
      code
    }
  }
}
```

### Removing a webhook

To fully remove a webhook, use the `webhookDelete` mutation:

```graphql {2}
mutation {
  webhookDelete(id: "V2ViaG9vazox") {
    webhookErrors {
      field
      code
    }
  }
}
```
