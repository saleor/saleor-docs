title: Introduction to GraphQL API
---


Saleor is based on GraphQL API. GraphQL is a query language which offers much more flexibility for integrations. It allows you to request the exact data you need, cutting down the number of calls you must perform to get it. The availability of all data at one endpoint is also the biggest advantage of GraphQL over the REST API (which has an endpoint for each resource object).

Using the Saleor GraphQL API allows you to query and modify all of your shopâ€™s data in an efficient and flexible manner. Our API provides both types of operations: 
* Public (related to the customers of your shop) 
* Private (related to the administration side)
