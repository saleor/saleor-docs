## Endpoint

Our API is available under a `/graphql` endpoint. The endpoint remains constant regardless of the operation you perform.

Requests must be sent using the HTTP `POST` method and `application/json` content type.

To view and try out our API, visit the [Playground](https://demo.saleor.io/graphql/).
