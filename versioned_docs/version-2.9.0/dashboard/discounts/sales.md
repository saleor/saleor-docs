## Using sales in Saleor

Sales are an excellent way to encourage customers to use your store. Saleor offers you a range of sale options:

- Specific price reductions or percentage discounts
- Sales on single or grouped products, categories, and collections
- Flexible time periods for sales events, which can be deactivated and reactivated at any time.


## How to create a sale

**1. Add a new sale**

Click _Create&nbsp;Sale_ above the main sales list and fill in the relevant sections.

**2. General Information card**

Add the name of your sale. This can be edited later.


**3. Pricing**

**Discount Value:** Use the icon on the right side of the Discount Value field to toggle between percentage discount and price-per-item discount.

**Time Frame:** Use the pop-up calendar or stepper to choose the start and end dates of the sale. If you do not set a start date, the sale will start immediately; similarly, a sale without an end date will continue indefinitely.


**4. Summary**

Once you have set the basic parameters of your sale and saved them, the summary section on the right side of the page will show an overview of the event.


**5. Assign categories, collections or products**

Select the items in your sale. The categories section allows you to select individual products, assign entire categories, or assign entire pre-created collections.
