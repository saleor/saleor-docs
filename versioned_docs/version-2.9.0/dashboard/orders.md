## Introduction

The Orders section shows you all orders placed through the Saleor system by customers, as well as those created manually by administrators. An order is created once a customer completes the checkout process.

## Order types

There are essentially two order types in Saleor:

* Regular orders - Orders created by your customers.

* Draft orders - These are orders created by administrators, which have not yet been released to the system. For example, store operators can create orders during discussions with customers, then save them as drafts until approval is gained from management to send replacement goods. Draft orders can be edited in the same way that an order is created. 

To process an order in the system, click _Finalize_ in the footer. Once the order is finalized, stock inventory will be affected. Unreleased draft orders do not influence actual or predicted stock levels. 

## Order list page

The main page shows a list of all orders in the system, regardless their status.

### Order filters  

To automatically filter orders, use the drop-down menu and view orders by date or fulfillment status. Sorting by status brings up a second menu from which you can choose _Fulfilled_, _Partially Fulfilled_, or _Unfilled Orders_. Click _Add filter_ to apply the filter. 

You can also manually search specific information, such as key words or names, using the Search Orders field. The filter is dynamically applied as you type.

## Order details page

Click on any order record from the list to get the full details. The order page contains cards indicating order fulfillment status, payment stage, order history, customer details and notes.

### Order fulfillment card
The fulfillment represents a group of shipped items with corresponding tracking number. Fulfillments are created by a shop operator to mark selected products in an order as fulfilled.

Fulfillment means whether an order has been sent to the customer or not. Some orders will only have a single _Unfulfilled_ or _Fulfilled_ card. Others, as in the example below, will have both cards if parts of the order have been sent to the customer but other products are yet to be dispatched.

#### Fulfillment statuses

There are four possible order statuses (and a _Daft_ one), based on the stage of their fulfillment:

* **Unfulfilled** - There are no fulfillments related to an order or each one is canceled. An action by a shop operator is required to continue order processing.


* **Partially fulfilled** - There are some fulfillments with _Fulfilled_ status related to an order. An action by a shop operator is required to continue order processing.


* **Fulfilled** - Each order line is fulfilled in existing fulfillments. Order doesn’t require further actions by a shop operator.


* **Cancelled** - Order has been canceled. Every fulfillment (if there is any) has _Cancelled_ status. Order doesn’t require further actions by a shop operator.


* **Draft** - Used for orders newly created from dashboard and not yet published.

### Order payment card

Orders are managed and processed in relation to their payment status. So each order status is closely linked to the processing stage of payment. There are the following payment stages:

* Unpaid - It reflects the traditional credit card or bank payment that is awaiting authorization from the bank. Unpaid amounts are listed as ‘pre-authorized’. Once funds are released, the order status will automatically change to fully paid.

* Fully paid - This indicates that the order has been paid for in full.

* Fully refunded - All charged funds were returned to the customer.

* Partially refunded - When a partial refund was given to a customer, for example, when one product from several ordered items is no longer available.

#### Authorization and capture

Some of the payment backends support pre-authorizing payments.

Authorization and capture is a two-step process.

First, the funds are locked on the payer’s account but are not transferred to your bank.

Then, depending on the gateway and card type used, you can charge the card for an amount not exceeding the authorized amount. 
Note, that the card may be charged in the timeframe between few days to a month from the day the funds were locked originally.

This is very useful when an exact price cannot be determined until after the order is prepared, or you want to capture the money as soon as you ship the order. It is also useful if you prefer to manually screen orders for fraud attempts.

When viewing orders with pre-authorized payments, Saleor offers options to either capture or void the funds. You can capture the full or partial amount (for example, taking only partial payment for an item due to damage, late delivery, or customer service issues) by clicking _Capture_ in the bottom right corner and then confirming the full amount or changing the price to the new amount agreed with the customer.

#### Refunds

Payments can be fully or partially refunded, if there is an issue with the goods or customer service.

### Order history

Every time you complete an action such as confirming and fulfilling an order, a note appears in the order timeline at the bottom of the page. Administrators can add notes about interactions with clients and other information for other store workers.

### Customer details

The customer information in the card to the right of the screen on a specific order is automatically generated when the customer completes a transaction. The billing and shipping addresses can be edited if necessary. There is also an option to directly contact the customer via email by clicking on the web address shown in the contact information card.

### Notes 

This card displays any additional information or remarks your customer made when placing the order.

## How to

### How to create an order

This is a function for store administrators to add orders, usually in cases where customer orders need to be re-sent but have already been fulfilled in the system. For example, if the customer was send damaged goods or is being sent a complimentary product due to customer service issues. It can also be used to create dummy and test orders, as well as to deal with stock issues.


1. Click _Create&nbsp;Order_ on the main orders page or the draft orders section

2. Click _Add&nbsp;Products_ in the Order Details card

3. Select products from the drop-down menu or by typing the product name in the search field. Assign using the check boxes

4. Choose the customer name. Other fields for customer information will then auto-complete. Make any required changes or input information for a new customer

5. Choose the best shipping offer from the drop-down list of available couriers

Once you set up the order and finalize it using the button in the footer, it becomes a normal order and replacement goods can be sent to the customer.

### How to fulfill an order

To fulfill an order, click _Fulfill_ in the Unfulfilled card and use the stepper to confirm which products are being send. 

In the example below, the t-shirt and hoodie are being sent in full, only two from four pairs of plimsolls are being sent, and the juice is not being sent.

Once you click _Confirm_, the t-shirt and hoodie will move to the Fulfilled card, as will two pairs of shoes. The other shoes and the juice will remain Unfulfilled.

If you have a tracking number for the package, add it in the field below the products.

:::note Automatic customer notifications
When fulfillment is confirmed, the customer will automatically receive an email with information about the goods that they will receive, including any additional information such as tracking numbers.
