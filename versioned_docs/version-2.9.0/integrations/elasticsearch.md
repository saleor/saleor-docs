## Installation

Elasticsearch search backend requires an Elasticsearch server.
For the installation guide, see the [official documentation](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/index.html).

You can configure an integration with the set of environment variables.

When deploying on Heroku - you can use an add-on which provides Elasticsearch as a service. By default, Saleor uses Elasticsearch 6.3.

When deploying somewhere else, you can use one of the following services:

- http://www.searchly.com/
- https://www.elastic.co/cloud

## Environment variables

`ELASTICSEARCH_URL` or `BONSAI_URL` or `SEARCHBOX_URL`

URL to the Elasticsearch engine. If it is empty, search is not available.

> **Example**
>
> `https://user:password@my-3rdparty-es.com:9200`

## Data indexing

Saleor uses [Django Elasticsearch DSL](https://github.com/sabricot/django-elasticsearch-dsl) as a wrapper for [Elasticsearch DSL](https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch-dsl-py) to enable automatic indexing and sync.
Indexes are defined in the [documents](https://github.com/saleor/saleor/search/documents.py) file.
Refer to documentation of above projects for help and tips.

The initial search index can be created with the following command:

```shell-session
python manage.py search_index --rebuild
```

:::note
By default, all indexed objects (products, users, orders) are re-indexed every time they are changed.

## Search integration architecture

Search backends use [Elasticsearch DSL](https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch-dsl-py) for query definition in saleor/search/backends.

There are two backends defined for Elasticsearch integration:

- [storefront](https://github.com/mirumee/saleor/blob/master/saleor/search/backends/elasticsearch_storefront.py) - Storefront search uses only the storefront index for a product-only search.
- [dashboard](https://github.com/mirumee/saleor/blob/master/saleor/search/backends/elasticsearch_dashboard.py) - The dashboard backend performs additional searches in user and order indexes.

## Testing

There are two levels of testing for search functionality.
Syntax of Elasticsearch queries is ensured by unit tests for the backend; [integration](https://github.com/saleor/saleor/tests/test_search.py) testing is done using [VCR.py](https://github.com/kevin1024/vcrpy) to mock external communication.

:::note
If you modify the search logic, make sure to record new communication and align test fixtures accordingly.
:::

Pytest will run VCR in never-recording mode on CI to make sure no attempts of communication are made, so make sure most recent cassettes are always included in your repository.
