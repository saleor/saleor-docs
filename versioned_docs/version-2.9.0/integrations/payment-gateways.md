title: Supported Payment Gateways
---

Each payment gateway integrated with Saleor comes as a plugin solution.

To activate your payment plugin, go to the [Plugins](dashboard/configuration/plugins.md) section in the Configuration tab of your Saleor dashboard.

Saleor supports the following payment gateways:

- `DUMMY` - for testing purposes only
- `BRAINTREE` - supports PayPal and Credit Cards
- `RAZORPAY` - supports only the paisa currency
- `STRIPE` - supports Credit Cards

The default configuration only uses the dummy backend. It is meant to allow developers to easily simulate different payment results.

:::note
All payment backends default to using sandbox mode. This is very useful for development. When deploying to a production server, make sure you use the production mode.
