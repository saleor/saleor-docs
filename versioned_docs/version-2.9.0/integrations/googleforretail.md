Saleor is equipped with tools for generating product feeds to be used with Google Merchant Center. The resulting file is a compressed CSV and it is saved in a location specified by the `saleor.data_feeds.google_merchant.FILE_PATH` variable.

To generate a feed, use the following command:

```shell-session
python manage.py update_feeds
```

:::tip
We recommend that you run this command periodically.

Merchant Center has few country-dependent settings. For this reason, make sure to validate your feed at Google dashboard. 

This is also a location where you can specify your shipping cost, which is a required feed-parameter in many countries. See [Google Support pages](https://support.google.com/merchants) for more information.

The _brand attribute_ is a field required by Google. The feed generator checks this in a variant attribute named _brand_ or _publisher_ (if not found, it checks in _product_).

The feed can be downloaded under the following url: `http://<yourserver>/feeds/google/`.
