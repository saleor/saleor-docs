title: Installation for Windows
---

The following instructions assume a 64-bit installation of Windows.

## Prerequisites

Before you are ready to run Saleor, you will need additional software installed on your computer.

### Python

Download the latest 3.7 Windows installer from the [Python download page](https://www.python.org/downloads/) and follow the installation steps.

Make sure that “**Add Python 3.7 to PATH**” is selected.

### Node.js

Saleor requires version 10 or later. Download the Windows installer from [Node.js downloads page](https://nodejs.org/en/download/).

Make sure that “**Add to PATH**” is selected.

### PostgreSQL

Saleor needs PostgreSQL version 9.4 or above to work. Get the Windows installer from the [project’s download page](https://www.postgresql.org/download/windows/).

:::tip
Make a note of the password you set for the administration account during the installation process.
:::

### GTK+

Download and install the [64-bit Windows installer](https://github.com/tschoonj/GTK-for-Windows-Runtime-Environment-Installer).

Make sure that “\*_Set up PATH environment variable to include GTK+_” is selected.

### Compilers

Download and install the latest version of the [Build Tools for Visual Studio](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=840931).

## Installation

Once you have installed or updated the pre-requisite software, you are ready to install Saleor. Follow the steps below to start and execute the process:

:::note
All commands need to be performed in either PowerShell or a Command Shell.
:::

### 1. Clone the repository (replace the URL with your own fork where needed)

```shell-session
git clone https://github.com/mirumee/saleor.git
```

### 2. Enter the directory

```shell-session
cd saleor/
```

### 3. Install all dependencies

We strongly recommend [creating a virtual environment](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/venv.html) before installing any Python packages.

```shell-session
python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 4. Set `SECRET_KEY` environment variable

We try to provide usable default values for all the settings. We have decided not to provide a default for `SECRET_KEY` as we fear someone would inevitably ship a project with the default value left in code.

```shell-session
$env:SECRET_KEY = "<mysecretkey>"
```

:::warning
The secret key should be a unique string that only your team knows. Running the code with a known `SECRET_KEY` defeats many of Django’s security protections. It can also lead to privilege escalation and remote code execution vulnerabilities. Consult [Django’s documentation](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.11/ref/settings/#secret-key) for details.
:::

### 5. Create a PostgreSQL user

Use the **pgAdmin** tool that comes with your PostgreSQL installation to create a database user for your store.

Unless configured otherwise, the store will use `saleor` as both the username and password. Remember to assign your user the `SUPERUSER` privilege. This will allow you to create databases and database extensions.

### 6. Create a PostgreSQL database

See [PostgreSQL’s createdb command](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/static/app-createdb.html) for details.

:::note
The database name is extracted from the `DATABASE_URL` environment variable. If absent, it defaults to `saleor`.
:::

### 7. Prepare the database

```shell-session
python manage.py migrate
```

:::warning
This command creates database extensions. If you get an error related to the `CREATE EXTENSION` command, please return to the instructions in the PostgreSQL user creation step.
:::

### 8. Install front-end dependencies

```shell-session
npm install
```

:::note
If this step fails, make sure you are using a recent version of Node.js.
:::

### 9. Prepare front-end assets

```shell-session
npm run build-assets
```

### 10. Compile e-mails

```shell-session
npm run build-emails
```

### 11. Start the development server:

```shell-session
python manage.py runserver
```
