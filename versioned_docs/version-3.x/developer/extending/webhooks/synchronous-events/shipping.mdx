## Introduction

:::info

This feature was introduced in **Saleor 3.1**.

:::

Synchronous webhooks for shipping methods allow Saleor Apps to control shipping methods available for checkouts and draft orders.

### List external shipping methods

This solution can be used whenever shipping methods need to be fetched from a 3rd party API or when the pricing logic built into Saleor is insufficient for your needs.

External shipping methods can be used alone or with internal shipping methods. Saleor will return both the internal methods (defined through the Saleor Dashboard and stored in the `ShippingMethod` model) and external methods returned from the sync webhook.

#### Subscribe to the webhook

Saleor Apps can subscribe to the `SHIPPING_LIST_METHODS_FOR_CHECKOUT` synchronous webhook. It is called whenever
shipping methods are queried for a checkout object.

```graphql
{
  checkout(token: "checkout-uuid-token") {
    shippingMethods {
      id
      name
    }
  }
}
```

#### Request format

This is an example response from the application:

```json

]
```

#### Response format

This is an example response from the application:

```json
[
  {
    "id": "method-1",
    "name": "Same Day Delivery",
    "amount": 10.0,
    "currency": "USD"
  },
  {
    "id": "method-2",
    "name": "Standard Delivery",
    "amount": 0.0,
    "currency": "USD",
    "maximum_delivery_days": 14
  }
]
```

#### Selecting shipping methods

External shipping methods have an ID of the following format: `app:<app-database-id>:<id-returned-by-webhook>`

They are selected using the same mutations as internal shipping methods, e.g.:

```graphql
mutation {
  checkoutDeliveryMethodUpdate(
    token: "915d9405-629f-4ef2-98f4-8480d5cf827f"
    deliveryMethodId: "YXBwOjEyMzQ6c29tZS1pZA=="
  ) {
    checkout {
      deliveryMethod {
        ... on ShippingMethod {
          id
          name
        }
      }
    }
    errors {
      code
      message
    }
  }
}
```

Information about an external shipping method is stored in the order's private metadata. This entry should be kept to allow the shipping method to be correctly displayed in the dashboard.

### Filter shipping methods

#### Subscribe to the webhook

Saleor Apps can subscribe to the synchronous webhooks:

- `CHECKOUT_FILTER_SHIPPING_METHODS` is called whenever shipping methods are listed for a checkout
- `ORDER_FILTER_SHIPPING_METHODS` is called whenever shipping methods are listed for an order

#### Request format

Example request for `CHECKOUT_FILTER_SHIPPING_METHODS`:

#### Response format

This is an example response from the application:

```json
{
  "excluded_methods": [
    {
      "id": "U2hpcHBpbmdNZXRob2Q6MQ==",
      "reason": "Same Day Delivery is no longer available."
    },
    {
      "id": "U2hpcHBpbmdNZXRob2Q6MTQ=",
      "reason": "Bulky items are not allowed for standard shipping."
    }
  ]
}
```

#### Implementation guide

`ShippingMethod` objects returned by `Checkout.shippingMethods` and `Order.shippingMethods` will have 2 attributes:

- `active` which is set to `false` when at least one of the Saleor Apps excludes the methods;
- `message` which concatenates the exclusion reason coming from each of the Apps;

```graphql
{
  checkout(token: "checkout-uuid-token") {
    shippingMethods {
      id
      name
      active
      message
    }
  }
}
```

:::warning
Even though external methods are also subject to filtering, we recommend integrating only one of the two approaches,
as every single synchronous webhook affects the response time of your Saleor API.
