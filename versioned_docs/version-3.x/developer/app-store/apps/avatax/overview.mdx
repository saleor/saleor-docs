_AvaTax_ is a Saleor app that allows delegating tax calculations to [Avalara AvaTax](https://www.avalara.com/us/en/products/calculations.html).It can replace the default ([flat rates](developer/taxes.mdx#flat-rates)) tax calculation method in Saleor. It affects both the checkout and the order creation process.

Avalara AvaTax is a cloud-based solution automating transaction tax calculations and the tax filing process. Avalara
provides real-time tax calculation using tax content from more than 12,000 US taxing jurisdictions and over 200
countries, insuring your transaction tax is calculated based on the most current tax rules.

## Architecture

If you want to explore how the AvaTax App works, you can read the [AvaTax App architecture](./architecture) article.

## Configuration

### Channels

For a channel to appear on the _Available channels_ list, you must first select **"use tax app"** as its tax calculation method. You can do that on the _Tax Configuration_ page (_Configuration_ â†’ _Taxes_).

In the _Taxes_ page, select the channel and change the value of _Select the method of tax calculation_ to "_Use tax app_". Then save it and come back to the AvaTax App.

### Providers

In the _Tax providers_ section, you can manage your tax provider instances. Each tax provider instance is a different configuration. It can be used to have different settings per-channel, e.g. sandbox and production.

Visit [AvaTax](./configuration) page to learn how to set up the App.
