## Webhook events

The Taxes App uses the following webhook events for tax reporting and calculations:

- [`OrderCalculateTaxes`](api-reference/taxes/objects/calculate-taxes.mdx)
- [`CheckoutCalculateTaxes`](api-reference/taxes/objects/calculate-taxes.mdx)
- [`OrderConfirmed`](api-reference/orders/objects/order-confirmed.mdx)

## Calculating taxes

Calculating taxes using external tax providers happens through a synchronous [`CalculateTaxes`](api-reference/taxes/objects/calculate-taxes.mdx) webhook event. A [synchronous webhook](developer/extending/webhooks/synchronous-events/overview.mdx) awaits a response from the app before continuing.

While the app is waiting for the values of the calculated taxes, the sequence of actions is as follows:

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    CalculateTaxes->>+TaxesApp: Send webhook payload
    TaxesApp-->>-AppMetadata: Fetch app configuration from metadata
    AppMetadata-->>+TaxesApp: Return configuration
    TaxesApp-->>+TaxProvider: Use configuration & webhook payload to create transaction
    TaxProvider-->>-TaxesApp: Return created transaction
    TaxesApp-->>-CalculateTaxes: Transform the transaction and return as webhook response
```

During tax calculation, the transactions on the tax providers' side are not recorded. They will not appear in the tax provider's dashboard.

## Recording transactions

Once the order is finalized, we want to send a transaction to the tax provider for tax reporting. This is done through [asynchronous webhook](developer/extending/webhooks/asynchronous-events.mdx) events that fire on different order lifecycle actions.

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    OrderConfirmed->>+TaxesApp: Send webhook payload
    TaxesApp-->>-AppMetadata: Fetch app configuration from metadata
    AppMetadata-->>+TaxesApp: Return configuration
    TaxesApp-->>+TaxProvider: Use configuration & webhook payload to create transaction
    TaxProvider-->>-TaxesApp: Return created transaction
```

If the tax provider has a concept of committing or confirming transactions, it will happen during the transaction creation based on the provider configuration.

For example, in the case of AvaTax, the transaction is committed on `OrderConfirmed` if the `isAutocommit` flag is set to `true` in the configuration.

## Canceling transactions

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    OrderCancelled->>+TaxesApp: Send webhook payload
    TaxesApp-->>-AppMetadata: Fetch app configuration & transaction id from metadata
    AppMetadata-->>+TaxesApp: Return configuration & transaction id
    TaxesApp-->>+TaxProvider: Use configuration & webhook payload to cancel/void transaction
    TaxProvider-->>-TaxesApp: Return
```
