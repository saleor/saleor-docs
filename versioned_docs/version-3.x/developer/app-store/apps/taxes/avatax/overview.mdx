# AvaTax

Avalara AvaTax is a cloud-based solution automating transaction tax calculations and the tax filing process. Avalara
provides real-time tax calculation using tax content from more than 12,000 US taxing jurisdictions and over 200
countries, insuring your transaction tax is calculated based on the most current tax rules.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:

- You have created a [Avalara](https://www.avalara.com/) account.
- You have installed the Taxes App.

## Configuration

The AvaTax configuration form consists of three sections: _Credentials_, _Settings_, and _Address_.

Each configuration must have _Instance name_ - it is used to identify it across all the views.

### Credentials

Fields needed to authenticate the instance:

- Username - the username for the Avatax account. You will generate it in the Avalara dashboard (_Settings_ → _License and API keys_ → _License key_).
- Password - the password for the Avatax account. You will generate it in the Avalara dashboard (_Settings_ → _License and API keys_ → _License key_).
- Company code - the [company code](https://developer.avalara.com/ecommerce-integration-guide/sales-tax-badge/transactions/simple-transactions/company-codes/) for the AvaTax account.
- Sandbox - a flag that indicates whether the instance should use [the sandbox environment or the production environment](https://developer.avalara.com/erp-integration-guide/sales-tax-badge/authentication-in-avatax/sandbox-vs-production/).

### Settings

Fields that affect the created transactions:

- Autocommit - a flag that indicates whether the instance should [automatically commit the transactions](https://developer.avalara.com/communications/dev-guide_rest_v2/commit-uncommit/).
- Shipping tax code - the [tax code](https://taxcode.avatax.avalara.com) for shipping.
- [Document recording](#document-recording) - a flag that indicates whether the instance should [record the transactions](https://developer.avalara.com/ecommerce-integration-guide/sales-tax-badge/designing/disable-document-recording/).

#### Document recording

Taxes App creates AvaTax transactions on two events:

- while calculating taxes (in order or checkout)
- while confirming an order

When calculating taxes, the default [document type](https://developer.avalara.com/avatax/dev-guide/transactions/document-types/) is `SalesOrder`. It makes the transaction temporary and not visible in the Avalara dashboard.

In the case of order confirmation, the default document type is `SalesInvoice`. It makes the transaction permanent and visible in the Avalara dashboard.

The AvaTax configuration form in the Taxes App contains _Document recording_ toggle. When switched off, it changes all the document types to `SalesOrder`. This effectively stops the "document recording", making all the transactions temporary.

### Address

Fields that describe the address of the company.

After entering, the address must be verified by clicking the _Verify_ button that triggers AvaTax [address validation](https://developer.avalara.com/avatax/address-validation/). In response, AvaTax returns the validated address the user has to review. After either applying or rejecting suggestions, you can save the configuration.

## Mapping transaction fields

When an order is confirmed, the Taxes App [creates a transaction in AvaTax](https://developer.avalara.com/api-reference/avatax/rest/v2/methods/Transactions/CreateTransaction/). The transaction contains fields that are mapped from the order. For several fields, you can provide custom values with [`privateMetadata`](docs/developer/metadata.mdx#private-and-public-metadata). You have to make sure to set the value before confirming the order (e.g. when the order is still a draft).

The mutation for setting the private metadata is:

```graphql
mutation UpdatePrivateMetadata {
  updatePrivateMetadata(
    id: "ORDER_ID"
    input: { key: "METADATA_KEY", value: "METADATA_VALUE" }
  ) {
    item {
      metadata {
        key
        value
      }
    }
  }
}
```

where `ORDER_ID` is the id of the order, `METADATA_KEY` is key of the supported mapping, and `METADATA_VALUE` is the value for that field.

Taxes App supports the following mappings:

### Document code

**Metadata key: `avataxDocumentCode`**

By default, the [document code](https://developer.avalara.com/erp-integration-guide/sales-tax-badge/transactions/cert-document-codes/) is set to be equal to Saleor [`order`](docs/api-storefront/orders/objects/order.mdx) id.

If you want to override it, you can do so by providing a value for the `privateMetadata` field `avataxDocumentCode`.

:::caution
Due to AvaTax API restrictions, the document code will be sliced to be under 20 characters.

### Entity type

**Metadata key: `avataxEntityCode`**

AvaTax supports [`entityUseCode`](https://developer.avalara.com/erp-integration-guide/sales-tax-badge/designing/entity-code/) field that represents the type of customer the transaction is assigned to. The field is then used to determine the taxability of the transaction.

Let's say you have a draft order that was filled by tax-exempted US government entity. In AvaTax, the code for a "FEDERAL_GOV" entity is "A".

To map the entity type, you need to provide the value for the `entityUseCode` field of the Order `privateMetadata` field of key `avataxEntityCode` and value of "A".

### Tax calculation date

**Metadata key: `avataxTaxCalculationDate`**

By default, the [tax calculation date](https://developer.avalara.com/erp-integration-guide/sales-tax-badge/transactions/cert-tax-calc-date/) is set to be equal to the order creation date from Saleor [`order`](docs/api-storefront/orders/objects/order.mdx).

If you want to override it, you can do so by providing a value for the `privateMetadata` field `avataxTaxCalculationDate`.

:::info
The value of the `avataxTaxCalculationDate` field must be a valid UTC datetime string.
