title: Exporting Voucher Codes
---

## Introduction

Exporting voucher codes allows downloading a list of voucher codes to a CSV or an XLSX file.
You can export all codes from selected voucher or voucher codes with specific IDs.
The link to download the file is sent by email to the requestor. An email with information about the problems is sent if any error occurs.

### Export file structure

The exported file contains one column with a `code` header in the first row and voucher codes in the following rows, as shown below.

| code       |
| ---------- |
| winter2022 |
| voucher123 |
| spring2023 |

## Exporting voucher codes

:::note
Voucher codes can be exported only by logged users with `MANAGE_DISCOUNTS` permission.
:::

To export voucher codes, use `exportVoucherCodes` mutation.

This mutation takes the following input:

- `voucherId`: a ID of the voucher whose codes we want to export. This field is optional.
- `ids`: a list of voucher codes IDs to export. This field is optional.
- `fileType`: defines exported file type. You can choose between `CSV` and `XLSX` file.

One of the arguments `voucherId` or `ids` has to be provided.
.
As a result, this mutation returns `ExportFile` object which is a `Job` instance.
For details, look at [export mutations descriptions](export-overview#mutations).

### Exporting all codes for selected voucher

The following example shows how to export all codes from selected voucher to a CSV file.

```graphql {2}
mutation {
  exportVoucherCodes(input: { voucherId: "R2lmdENhcmQ6MjU=", fileType: CSV }) {
    exportFile {
      id
      status
      createdAt
      updatedAt
      url
    }
    errors {
      field
      code
      message
    }
  }
}
```

In the response, we get the workers information:

```json
{
  "data": {
    "exportVoucherCodes": {
      "exportFile": {
        "id": "RXhwb3J0RmlsZTox",
        "status": "PENDING",
        "createdAt": "2020-06-05T09:15:42.924676+00:00",
        "updatedAt": "2020-06-05T09:16:27.691838+00:00",
        "url": ""
      },
      "errors": []
    }
  }
}
```

Once the task is finished, the `url` field will contain the URL address of the exported file. If the `User` triggers export, the link to the file will be sent by email to the requestor.
To check if the URL is ready, you can fetch [ExportFile](export-overview#fetching-exportfile-instance).

### Exporting voucher codes with specified IDs

To export only voucher codes with provided IDs.

```graphql {4}
mutation {
  exportVoucherCodes(
    input: {
      ids: ["R2lmdENhcmQ6MjU=", "R2lmdENhcmQ6MjY=", "R2lmdENhcmQ6Mjc="]
      fileType: CSV
    }
  ) {
    exportFile {
      id
      status
      createdAt
      updatedAt
      url
    }
    errors {
      field
      code
      message
    }
  }
}
```
