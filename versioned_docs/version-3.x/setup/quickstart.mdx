## Saleor Cloud

Before you continue, make sure you went through:

- [Setting up your Saleor Cloud account](/cloud.mdx#getting-started)
- [Installing Saleor CLI](/cli.mdx#installing-the-cli)

### Storefront

:::info

Saleor hosts a demo shop to showcase all the main features of the platform. You can access it at [demo.saleor.io](https://demo.saleor.io/).

:::

The underlying technology of the demo shop is [saleor/react-storefront](https://github.com/saleor/react-storefront). It was built using Next.js, TypeScript and Tailwind CSS.

To spawn a fully-featured storefront connected to your Saleor project, run the following command using Saleor CLI:

```shell
saleor storefront create
```

### Starter

To set up a minimalistic Next.js & TypeScript boilerplate that only implements the basic features of Saleor, clone the [`saleor-next-starter`](https://github.com/saleor/saleor-next-starter) repository:

```shell
git clone https://github.com/saleor/saleor-next-starter.git
```

## Self-hosted

Before you continue, make sure you have installed:

- [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/install/)
- [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)

### Saleor Platform

If you want to run Saleor API along with all the major applications locally, you can use [`saleor-platform`](https://github.com/saleor/saleor-platform).

You can clone it like so:

```shell
git clone https://github.com/saleor/saleor-platform.git --recursive --jobs 3
```

To complete the setup, follow [the instructions in the README file](https://github.com/saleor/saleor-platform#how-to-run-it).
