## Preparation

Version 3.2 introduces some breaking changes necessary to ensure the highest quality of our API.

## JWT token expiration

Since Saleor 3.2, JWT token expiration time is set to 5 minutes and can be controlled server-side with `JWT_TTL_ACCESS` environment variable. See [Refreshing an access token](api-usage/authentication.mdx#refreshing-the-access-token) to learn how to refresh the token in your client app.

## Saleor Apps inside Dashboard

### Notification payloads

This change converts ID's from integers to GraphQL format in all notification payloads (email plugins and `NOTIFY` webhook).

Before:

```json
{
  "user": {
    "id": 68,
   ...
}
```

After:

```json
{
  "user": {
    "id": "VXNlcjo2OA==",
   ...
}
```
