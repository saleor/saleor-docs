Completes the checkout. As a result a new order is created. The mutation allows to create the unpaid order when setting `orderSettings.allowUnpaidOrders` for given `Channel` is set to `true`. When `orderSettings.allowUnpaidOrders` is set to `false`, checkout can be completed only when attached `Payment`/`TransactionItem`s fully cover the checkout's total. When processing the checkout with `Payment`, in case of required additional confirmation step like 3D secure, the `confirmationNeeded` flag will be set to True and no order will be created until payment is confirmed with second call of this mutation.
