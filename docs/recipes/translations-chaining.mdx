title: Translations chaining
---

Saleor is great for working with global brands available worldwide. When using Saleor to translate your content,
like products or attributes, you may notice that many languages exist in their local forms. For example, Portuguese and Portuguese (Brazil) or many dialects of English.

In this guide, we will implement a chain of translations that will result in the best customer-facing experience.

## The concept

Chaining of translations is a mechanism where a fully translated language is the main one (English, Portuguese, Spanish, etc.), while dialects are partially "patched" to reflect local differences.

## Example

Let's have a product called **Pen**. Our HQ will be in the US, so our root translation is American English. We can have a short description:

- **English:** It's a pen. No eraser needed!
- **English (United Kingdom):** It's a pen. No rubber needed, init mate!

The product name (Pen) will stay the same for both languages, while the description changes. In Saleor Dashboard, we translate only the description.

## Storefront implementation

In the storefront, we must first recognize what language is active for the current user. Let's assume we have it stored.

Then, we can execute the query to fetch a product:

```graphql
query {
  product(slug:"pen") {
    name
    description
    translation(languageCode:EN_GB) {
      description
      name
    }
  }
}
```

As a result, we will see translated fields only if they are filled:

```json
  {
    "product": {
      "name": "Pen",
      "description": "{\"time\": 1759301181747, \"blocks\": [{\"id\": \"FbMHH3B_mV\", \"data\": {\"text\": \"It's a pen. No eraser needed!\"}, \"type\": \"paragraph\"}], \"version\": \"2.30.7\"}",
      "translation": {
        "description": "{\"time\": 1759301204878, \"blocks\": [{\"id\": \"oW3SCISfmZ\", \"data\": {\"text\": \"It's a pen. No rubber needed!\"}, \"type\": \"paragraph\"}], \"version\": \"2.30.7\"}",
        "name": null
      }
    }
  }
```

Now, the storefront can decide to pick up the translated string and fall back to the main string if it doesn't exist:

```js
const productName = product.translation.name ?? product.name;
const productDescription = product.translation.description ?? product.description;
```
