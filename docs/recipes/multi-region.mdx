# Multi-Region Recipe 

Saleor provides a flexible approach to multi-region commerce through its channels' management capabilities, allowing businesses to operate across various regions, currencies, and markets from a single backend instance. This recipe explores how to set up and manage a multi-region shop using Saleor's channel architecture.

## Channels Setup

Saleor's approach to multi-region commerce is built around the concept of Channels. A channel in Saleor represents a specific sales context, which can be a geographical region, business model, brand, or sales channel. This architecture provides significant advantages over maintaining multiple separate instances of your e-commerce platform.

Create channels for individual countries or entire regions. Note that each channel supports only one currency. If you operate in regions with different currencies, create separate channels for each currency.

## Warehouses and Shipping Zones

Create at least one warehouse. You can choose different allocation strategies depending on your business logic. If your business has physical stores, you may want to add their locations as warehouses with a pick-up option.

Shipping zones define where products can be shipped and what shipping methods are available. Create a new one by giving it its name and choosing which counties it operates on. After its creation, you can add shipping methods that can further restrict its availability to certain postal code ranges.

Assign warehouse and shipping zone to their channels.

## Translations

Use translations to provide localized names and descriptions. You can translate product details, attributes, shipping options, and others.

To ensure email communication follows chosen language of the customer, use `Checkout.languageCode` field to store that information. It will be also available in Order entity, giving your email integration info which language should be used.

    />

## Payments and Taxes

Each region has it's popular payment gateways. Use one of the gateways available in the App Store, or implement your own.

Taxes often vary significantly between regions. If flat rates are not enough, you may want to use one of the existing apps or create your own. Each channel can be configured separately.

## Storefront Implementation

After configuring your channels in the Saleor backend, you'll need to implement the multi-region approach in your storefront.

Channel Selection in Storefront: Use different subdomains, automatically redirect customers based on their IP, or implement channel selection.

Multiple Storefront deployments: Some businesses might want to build separate storefronts aligned with a particular region. In this scenario channel will be hardcoded and multiple deployments will still use the same API.
