# Click and collect recipe 

Saleor's click and collect functionality enables customers to order products online and collect them from physical locations. This hybrid e-commerce model satisfies customers who want to minimize time spent in stores while still shopping from their favorite retailers. This report provides a comprehensive guide to configuring and implementing click and collect in your Saleor-powered e-commerce platform.

## Setting up collection points

Each physical location where customers can collect orders must be represented as a **Warehouse** in Saleor, even if you don't track inventory at that specific location. The Warehouse entity represents the physical address for pickup.

You should select "all warehouses" In the "Pickup" section of the Warehouse screen if other warehouses should be taken into account when presenting availability for this location.


<div style={{display: 'flex', gap: '1rem', flexWrap: 'wrap', paddingBottom: '4rem'}}>

        name="Warehouses docs"
        description="Read more about warehouses configuration."
        link="/developer/stock/stock-allocation#warehouse-configuration"
    />
</div>

## Storefront changes

A list of available collection points for a given checkout can be found in `Checkout.availableCollectionPoints` field. 

To select it, use the `checkoutDeliveryMethodUpdate` mutation. The shipping address of the checkout will be updated to chosen collection point.

<div style={{display: 'flex', gap: '1rem', flexWrap: 'wrap', paddingBottom: '4rem'}}>
    <CompactCard
        name="Saleor Storefront quickstart"
        description="Try example storefront build with NextJS."
        link="/quickstart/storefront"
    />

    <CompactCard
        name="Checkout shipping docs"
        description="Read more about shipping and checkout APIs."
        link="/developer/checkout/address"
    />
</div>


## Delivery status

When an order is picked up, staff users can use the Saleor Dashboard to update the fulfillment status as delivered. 

To integrate with existing order management software, create an app that will automatically synchronize status with Saleor API.

<div style={{display: 'flex', gap: '1rem', flexWrap: 'wrap', paddingBottom: '4rem'}}>
    <CompactCard
        name="Building Apps docs"
        description="Read more about creating your own integrations."
        link="/developer/extending/apps/overview"
    />

    <CompactCard
        name="Order fulfillment docs"
        description="Read more about order fulfillment APIs."
        link="/developer/order/order-fulfillment"
    />
</div>
