# Click and Collect Recipe

Saleor's click and collect functionality enables customers to order products online and collect them from physical locations. This hybrid e-commerce model satisfies customers who want to minimize time spent in stores while still shopping from their favorite retailers. This report provides a comprehensive guide to configuring and implementing click and collect in your Saleor-powered e-commerce platform.

## Setting Up Collection Points

Each physical location where customers can collect orders must be represented as a **Warehouse** in Saleor, even if you don't track inventory at that specific location. The Warehouse entity represents the physical address for pickup.

In the Warehouse screen's "Pickup" section, select "all warehouses" if you want to consider other warehouses when showing availability for this location.

## Storefront Changes

You can find available collection points in the `Checkout.availableCollectionPoints` field. To select a collection point, use the `checkoutDeliveryMethodUpdate` mutation. This will update the checkout's shipping address to the chosen collection point.

## Delivery Status

When a customer picks up their order, staff users can mark the fulfillment as delivered in the Saleor Dashboard.

To integrate with your existing order management system, you can create an app that automatically syncs status with the Saleor API.
