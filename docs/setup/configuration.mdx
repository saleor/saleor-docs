import Tabs from "@theme/Tabs";
import TabItem from "@theme/TabItem";

Saleor follows the [12-factor](https://12factor.net/) approach, so you can configure Saleor using environment variables.

Below is a list of available environment variables and their default values.

## Setting environment variables

While most production environments offer a way to configure the environment, you will likely want to set them on your local development machine first.

<Tabs defaultValue="cmd" values={[
    { label: "Windows (Command Prompt)", value: "cmd" },
    { label: "Windows (PowerShell)", value: "ps" },
    { label: "Linux/MacOS", value: "posix" },
    { label: "Docker", value: "docker" }
]}>
<TabItem value="cmd">

To set the variable temporarily, until the terminal window is closed:

```shell
set SECRET_KEY "<mysecretkey>"
```

To permanently set the variable:

```shell
setx SECRET_KEY "<mysecretkey>"
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="ps">

To set the variable temporarily, until the terminal window is closed:

```shell
$Env:SECRET_KEY = "<mysecretkey>"
```

To permanently set the variable:

```shell
setx SECRET_KEY "<mysecretkey>"
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="posix">

To set the variable temporarily, until the terminal window is closed:

```shell
export SECRET_KEY="<mysecretkey>"
```

To permanently set the variable, use [direnv](https://direnv.net/).

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="docker">

Use the `--env` flag to pass environment variables to Docker containers:

```shell
docker run --env SECRET_KEY="<mysecretkey>" saleor
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

## General configuration

### `ALLOWED_CLIENT_HOSTS`

A list of strings representing host/domain names of client applications (storefront or dashboard) that use this Saleor instance as a backend. Values in this list should be URLs in [RFC 1808](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc1808) format.

Some operations, such as registering a new account or resetting the password, involve sending an email from the backend with a link that users need to click to confirm the action. The backend doesn't know the structure of frontend applications' routing, and the path to the view where users can proceed with the operation needs to be passed as arguments in GraphQL mutations. These paths are validated against URLs configured in the `ALLOWED_CLIENT_HOSTS` setting.

`ALLOWED_CLIENT_HOSTS` is required in production mode (with `DEBUG=False`). In local development (`DEBUG=True`), when it's not set, the paths are validated against `localhost, 127.0.0.1`.

Multiple values should be separated with a comma.

### `ALLOWED_GRAPHQL_ORIGINS`

Controls the value of [`Access-Control-Allow-Origin`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Access-Control-Allow-Origin) response header. Defaults to `*`.

### `ALLOWED_HOSTS`

This variable controls [Django's allowed hosts](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.0/ref/settings/#allowed-hosts) setting. It defaults to `localhost`.

Multiple values should be separated with a comma.

### `CACHE_URL` or `REDIS_URL`

The URL of a cache database. It defaults to local process memory.

Redis is recommended.

**Example**: `redis://redis.example.com:6379/0`

### `CELERY_BROKER_URL`

Default task broker URL. You can read more about configuring this at [Celery Documentation.](https://docs.celeryproject.org/en/stable/userguide/configuration.html#broker-url)

### `CHECKOUT_TTL_BEFORE_RELEASING_FUNDS`

Defines the TTL of checkout before it is marked as abandoned, and assigned funds will be released. The value should be a time expression like `5m`, `5 minutes`, `5d`, `5 days`, `1w`, or `1 week`. Defaults to `6 hours`.

### `DATABASE_URL`

The connection URL to a PostgreSQL database. Defaults to `postgres://saleor:saleor@localhost:5432/saleor`.

Format: `postgres://<username>:<password>@<hostname>:<port>/<database-name>`

### `DEBUG`

Controls [Django's debug mode](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.0/ref/settings/#s-debug). It defaults to `True`.

### `DEFAULT_COUNTRY`

Indicates the default country of your store. Depending on what setup you require, this variable also controls the default VAT, shipping country, etc. Defaults to `US`.

### `DEFAULT_CURRENCY`

Indicates a default currency which is a basis for all prices entered and stored in your store. Defaults to `USD`.

### `DEFAULT_FROM_EMAIL`

Indicates a default email address to use for all outgoing mail.

### `ENABLE_DEBUG_TOOLBAR`

Controls whether to run [Django Debug Toolbar](https://django-debug-toolbar.readthedocs.io/en/latest/). Defaults to `False`.

To use the toolbar, you must also enable the `PLAYGROUND_ENABLED` setting. Then, the toolbar will be rendered when accessing the `/graphql/` URL.
Note that using the toolbar is recommended only locally and should be disabled in production, as it affects the performance and may potentially reveal sensitive or private information.

### `ENABLE_SSL`

Used while generating URLs. Set to `True` if Saleor is deployed behind HTTPS. Defaults to `False`.

:::caution
If the [`PUBLIC_URL`](#public_url) is set, it takes precedence over the `ENABLE_SSL` setting when generating URLs.
:::

### `EMAIL_URL`

The URL of the email gateway. Defaults to printing everything to the console.

Some examples:

| Description               | URL                                                                           |

:::

### `USER_EMAIL_URL`

The URL used by [`UserEmails`](../developer/app-store/legacy-plugins/user-emails).

Some examples:

| Description               | URL                                                                           |

**Example:** `smtp://user:password@smtp.example.com:465/?ssl=True`

:::caution
If your password contains special characters, it has to be percentencoded. [Read more](https://github.com/migonzalvar/dj-email-url?tab=readme-ov-file#supported-backends)
:::

### `FEDERATED_QUERY_MAX_ENTITIES`

Sets upper limit on how many entities may be requested by Apollo Federation's gateway for a single GraphQL query. Defaults to `100`. Set to `0` to remove this limit.

### `GRAPHQL_QUERY_MAX_COMPLEXITY`

Controls maximum allowed complexity (cost) of a GraphQL query. If the query's complexity exceeds this limit, it will not be executed, and GraphQL API will return an error instead.

Set `0` to remove this limit.

### `INTERNAL_IPS`

Controls [Django's internal IPs setting](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.0/ref/settings/#s-internal-ips). Defaults to `127.0.0.1`.

Multiple values should be separated with a comma.

### `HTTP_IP_FILTER_ENABLED`

_Added in v3.16_

A boolean setting that controls whether or not to enable IP filtering in HTTP(S) network calls
(webhooks, OIDC, etc.).

When set to `True` (default) it will reject private and loopback IP address ranges
(see also [`HTTP_IP_FILTER_ALLOW_LOOPBACK_IPS`](#http_ip_filter_allow_loopback_ips)).

It defaults to `True`, and is recommended to be enabled on environments where staff users
are untrusted, and thus could lead to [SSRF attacks](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/918.html).

### `HTTP_IP_FILTER_ALLOW_LOOPBACK_IPS`

_Added in v3.16_

When set to `False` (default), the HTTP IP filter will reject loopback IP addresses
(127.0.0.0 to 127.255.255.255 range).

### `JWT_TTL_ACCESS`

The time until JWT access tokens expire. The value should be a time expression like `5m`, `5 minutes`, `5d`, `5 days`, `1w`, or `1 week`. Defaults to `5 minutes`.

### `JWT_TTL_REFRESH`

The time until JWT refresh tokens expire. The value should be a time expression like `5m`, `5 minutes`, `5d`, `5 days`, `1w`, or `1 week`. Defaults to `30 days`.

### `JWT_TTL_REQUEST_EMAIL_CHANGE`

The time until email change request tokens expire. The value should be a time expression like `5m`, `5 minutes`, `5d`, `5 days`, `1w`, or `1 week`. Defaults to `1 hour`.

### `RSA_PRIVATE_KEY`

The RSA private key in PEM format is used for signing Saleor's JWT tokens. This is unnecessary in the DEBUG mode as Saleor will generate a temporary private key. It is required in production environments.

### `RSA_PRIVATE_PASSWORD`

The password is required for loading `RSA_PRIVATE_KEY`. Default set to `None`.

### `MAX_CHECKOUT_LINE_QUANTITY`

Controls the maximum quantity of a line item that can be added to a single checkout. Defaults to `50`.

### `MEDIA_URL`

Controls [Django's `MEDIA_URL`](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.0/ref/settings/#media-url) setting. Defaults to `/media/`.

### `PUBLIC_URL`

Specifies the base URL at which Saleor is hosted, such as `https://api.example.com/`. This setting takes precedence over both [`ENABLE_SSL`](#enable_ssl) and `Shop.domain` (set using the GraphQL API) when generating URLs. Ensure to provide the complete URL, including the protocol: `http://` or `https://`.

### `PLAYGROUND_ENABLED`

Controls whether to run [Playground](https://github.com/prisma-labs/graphql-playground) - the interactive GraphQL explorer - when accessing the `/graphql/` URL exposed by Saleor. Defaults to `True`.

### `SECRET_KEY`

Controls [Django's secret key](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.0/ref/settings/#s-secret-key) setting.

### `STATIC_URL`

Controls the production assets mount path. Defaults to `/static/`.

### `BREAKER_BOARD_ENABLED`

Enables the [circuit breaker](developer/extending/webhooks/synchronous-events/circuit-breakers.mdx) feature for sync webhooks.

### `BREAKER_BOARD_SYNC_EVENTS`

List of comma separated, lowercase sync webhook events, which should be monitored by the breaker board.
For example: `"checkout_calculate_taxes, shipping_list_methods_for_checkout"`.

### `BREAKER_BOARD_DRY_RUN_SYNC_EVENTS`

Sets the circuit breaker to dry run mode, in which events will be monitored but no blockage of webhooks will occur when the failure threshold is exceeded.
Breaker events will still be logged, which is useful for testing the breaker without affecting the webhooks behavior.

## Currency exchange

Saleor can automatically convert amounts between currencies. To use this feature, you will need an [Open Exchange Rates account](https://openexchangerates.org/).

### `OPENEXCHANGERATES_API_KEY`

Your store's Open Exchange Rates "App ID".

## Updating domain configuration

When deploying Saleor under a specific domain, such as `api.example.com`, it's essential to ensure that Saleor is properly configured to generate URLs. This can be achieved using the [`PUBLIC_URL`](#public_url) environment variable. Once configured, Saleor will effectively generate URLs tailored to its domain, ensuring smooth bidirectional communication.
