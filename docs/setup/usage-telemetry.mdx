title: Usage Telemetry
---

Saleor includes a telemetry system that collects anonymous, aggregated usage data. This data helps the development team understand how Saleor is used across the vast seas, allowing us to prioritize features, optimize performance, and identify trends in the self-hosted ecosystem.

:::info
Please note that this feature is distinct from the [OpenTelemetry-based observability](/setup/telemetry) available in Saleor and serves a different purpose.

## What we are collecting

The telemetry will collect high-level, aggregate data about your Saleor instance. It does **not** collect customer data, order details, or any business secrets.

The collected data includes basic metrics such as:

- Saleor version
- Counts of key entities (products, attributes, channels, and models)
- A list of configured currencies
- Count of installed apps and a list of Saleor-provided apps

For reference you may want to look into the [code](https://github.com/saleor/saleor/blob/main/saleor/asgi/usage_telemetry.py) that actually collects the data.

## What we are NOT collecting

We want to be crystal clear about what data never leaves your server. The telemetry system does **not** collect your product catalog content, stock levels, pricing, or revenue figures. Furthermore, absolutely no checkout or order data—such as customer names, addresses, or transaction histories—is ever accessed or transmitted.

## Your Privacy and Security come first

Trust is essential in open source. We have designed this system with privacy as the top priority.

- **Anonymous:** We assign a random, unique identifier to each deployment. This allows us to see how metrics change over time (e.g., if a store grows) without identifying who owns the store or where it is hosted.
- **No Sensitive Data:** We do not collect any personally identifiable information (PII) or sensitive business data.
- **Encrypted:** All data is sent securely using encryption.

## How it works

The telemetry collection happens during the application startup. It is designed to be completely non-intrusive and **will not delay your startup time or impact site performance.**

**Participation is optional.** While sharing this data aids the entire Saleor community, we respect your decision if you prefer not to.

## Opting out

Usage telemetry is enabled by default to help us improve the platform for everyone. However, you can opt out of data collection at any time.

To disable usage telemetry, start your Saleor deployment with following environment variable:

```bash
SEND_USAGE_TELEMETRY=false
```

## Additional configuration

By default usage telemetry will not be sent more than once a day. You can change that setting with an environment variable.

```bash
# Configures usage telemetry to not be sent more than once every 7 days.
SEND_USAGE_TELEMETRY_AFTER_TIMEDELTA="7 days"
```
