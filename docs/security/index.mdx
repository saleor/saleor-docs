This document describes the different security measures and deployment settings provided by Saleor.

## External Connectivity

### HTTP Redirects and Timeouts

Out of the box, Saleor disables HTTP redirects for outgoing connections, and sets a strict timeout value (typically \<20s).

This is a design choice intended to prevent potential Denial of Service (DoS) attacks from being done by internal actors.

Without such measure in place, a malicious staff user could, for example, create an infinite redirection loop in a malicious endpoint and exhaust server resources.

Timeout settings cannot be overridden dynamically. However, they can be altered inside [`settings.py`](https://github.com/saleor/saleor/blob/1f2127e1e92722cecae7409c0d26ac7ab05d23d8/saleor/settings.py#L961-L968).

### IP Address Filtering (SSRF Protection)

This section describes the IP address filtering capabilities of [Saleor Core]. **By default, Saleor rejects any outgoing traffic to private and loopback IP addresses.**

This behavior prevents malicious staff users from accessing inward-facing resources, which could lead to unauthorized access to resources you may deploy within your networks or even gaining a foothold (such as achieving lateral movements to gain more privileges).

For in-depth details, refer to:

* [CWE-918: Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/918.html)
* [The OWASP community page about SSRF attacks](https://owasp.org/www-community/attacks/Server_Side_Request_Forgery)

**Implementation Details:**

* **IP Addresses are Pinned:**  the resolved IP address for each outgoing HTTP(S) request is pinned, meaning that a malicious actor cannot set-up round-robin DNS responses or use race-condition attacks ([Time-of-Check](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/367.html)) to trick Saleor into connecting to a different IP address after validation.
* **IP Address Validation for Each Request:**  validation is ran before sending each and every HTTP(S) request. This prevents a malicious actor from changing the DNS records after adding a non-malicious URL inside the database.

**Settings:**

* [`HTTP_IP_FILTER_ENABLED`](https://docs.saleor.io/setup/configuration#http_ip_filter_enabled) - controls whether the IP filtering feature should be enabled. **IP Filtering is enabled by default.**
* [`HTTP_IP_FILTER_ALLOW_LOOPBACK_IPS`](https://docs.saleor.io/setup/configuration#http_ip_filter_allow_loopback_ips) - whether to allow outgoing traffic to loopback addresses. **Loopback addresses are** **disallowed** **by default.**

**Caveats:**

* **Allow-Lists:**  it is not currently possible to put given IP addresses into an allow-list (or block-list). It currently only supports: "block-all" or "allow-all".

**Additional Capabilities:**

* **Proxies:**  SOCKS and HTTP proxies can be used in combination with the IP Filtering.

  * The IP address used to establish the proxy tunnel itself is not restricted. However, any HTTP requests sent through the proxy will be filtered based on their destination IP address.

    For example, setting `HTTPS_PROXY=socks5://10.0.0.1:8888` is allowed, but attempting to access `https://10.0.0.2` **through** the tunnel will be blocked.
  * Can be configured through environment variables, such as:

    ```bash
    $ export HTTP_PROXY="http://10.10.1.10:3128"
    $ export HTTPS_PROXY="http://10.10.1.10:1080"
    # Alternatively:
    $ export ALL_PROXY="http://10.10.1.10:1080"
    ```
* **HTTP redirects:**  each redirection is checked whether it points to a private or loopback IP address range.
