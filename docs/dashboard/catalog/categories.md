Products on the Saleor platform can be sorted by category if you sell a range of items.


## Adding a Category

Click [[Add&nbsp;Category]] to enter a new set of products. Enter the category name, description, and SEO-optimized information the same way as you would with an individual product. When finished, click [[Save&nbsp;Category]] in the bottom right corner and then add a widescreen banner photo that will appear at the top of the screen when customers view the category.

## Editing Categories

Once you have your categories, you can edit them at any time by clicking on a category from the list and changing information. When viewing a category, you have a card at the bottom of the page with tabs for viewing and editing products and sub-catgeories.  


## Sub-categories

Sub-categories break large groups down into smaller subsets that make it easier to manage stores and help customers find the right products. 

### How to Add a Sub-Category

Click [[Add&nbsp;Subcategory]] in the top right corner of the sub-categories card. In this example, we have paints and cushions in the Accessories category, which can be marked as separate sub-categories. Add a description and SEO information just the same as with a main category.

## Deleting Categories

To remove a category, simply click [[Delete&nbsp;Category]] in the footer.

> **Warning** 
>
> ##### Be cautious when deleting categories
>
> Products are mandatorily assigned to categories. Deleting a category will also remove all products it contains. Only remove a category if you are sure that you also want to permanently delete all its products from your catalog.
