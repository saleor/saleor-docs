## Product Types

Define the type of products you sell and organize them into groups. The Product Types list shows the type of product, a description of whether it is a physical or digital product, and which tax applies to its sale.


### Adding a Product Type

Click [[Add&nbsp;Product&nbsp;Type]] above the main product types list. The initial page has cards for Information, Shipping, and Taxes. A Product Attributes section also appears once the Product Type is saved.

### Information

Choose your Product Type Name. In this example, a bike comes under ‘sporting goods’.


### Shipping

If you have physical products to send to customers, you need to check the [[Is&nbsp;this&nbsp;product&nbsp;shippable?]] checkbox. An additional field will then appear to note the weight of the products, which is essential for calculating shipping costs.


### Taxes

Different goods are taxed differently across the world. If you leave the Tax Rate field blank, the system will assume that the product is classified as a standard taxable item. Click on the drop-down list to assign non-standard classifications. This is very important, as it means you are legally charging the correct amount for products. For example, educational materials may be tax exempt, while some hazardous substances have higher tax rates.


### Adding Attributes and Variants

Once you have created your Product Type and added tax and shipping information, click [[Save]] to create the new classification. An additional card will appear for adding Attributes and Variants to the Product Type. Add the new attribute or variant and then click [[Save]]. 


### Removing a Product Type

There are two ways to remove a Product Type:

- Select it from the main list, then choose [[Remove]] in the footer
- Check the box on the main list and then click the trash can that appears above. You can remove single or multiple product types simulataneously from the list.

Confirm the cancellation in both cases by clicking [[Delete]] in the pop-up window.
