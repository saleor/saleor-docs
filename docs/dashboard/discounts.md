Create attractive sales offers on individual products or a wider selection. Add vouchers to offer selected customers great deals on products and shipping


## Sales

Sales are an excellent way to encourage customers to use your store. Saleor offers you a range of sale options:

- Specific price reductions or percentage discounts
- Sales on single or grouped products, categories, and collections
- Flexible time periods for sales events, which can be deactivated and reactivated at any time.


### Creating a Sale

Click [[Add Sale]] above the main sales list and fill in the relevant sections.

#### General Information 

Add the name of your sale. This can be edited later.


#### Pricing

**Discount Value:** Use the icon on the right side of the Discount Value field to toggle between percentage discount and price-per-item discount.

**Time Frame:** Use the pop-up calendar or stepper to choose the start and end dates of the sale. If you do not set a start date, the sale will start immediately; similarly, a sale without an end date will continue indefinitely.


#### Summary

Once you have set the basic parameters of your sale and saved them, the summary section on the right side of the page will show an overview of the event.


#### Categories

Select the items in your sale. The categories section allows you to select individual products, assign entire categories, or assign entire pre-created collections.

## Vouchers

### How to Add a Voucher Offer

#### 1. Enter the Add Voucher Screen

Click [[Add&nbsp;Voucher]] above the main list on the vouchers page to get started.

#### 2. Add General Information

There are two options to give your voucher a name:

- Type a name like ‘BlackFridayVoucher’ into the Discount Code box
- Click [[Generate&nbsp;Code]] to create a randomized voucher code 

#### 3. Choose Discount Type

Choose if your voucher is:

- Fixed Amount: A specific dollar-amount discount on one or all products
- Percentage Discount: A percentage discount on all products in an order or only the least expensive one
- Free Shipping: No shipping charge for all items in an order

#### 4. Input Voucher Value

Input the fixed amount or percentage value of the voucher.

#### 5. Choose Single or Multiple Products

Decide where the fixed-value or percentage-value voucher applies to all products in an order or only to the cheapest one.

#### 6. Apply Discount to All Products or Only Full Price Products

You can decide if your offer applies to products which are already discounted in other sales or if it only covers full price products. Check the slider to choose the right option. 

#### 7. Set Minimum Requirements

Vouchers are a great upselling opportunity. You can choose a minimum order value or quantity of products that customers must reach before the voucher can be applied, or you can choose [[None]] and apply the voucher to all products.

#### 8. Set Usage Limit

Choose the total number of vouchers available to all customers. You can create single vouchers for specific customers, a wider offer in limited numbers, or an unlimited number of vouchers for a set period of time.

Choose if each customer (defined by e-mail address) can use the voucher only once or multiple times.

#### 9. Choose the Dates

Leave the start date blank in [[Active&nbsp;Dates]] if you want the offer to start immediately. Similarly, leave the end date blank if the voucher will remain valid indefinitely. If the offer is for a specific time, input the start and/or end dates and times.
