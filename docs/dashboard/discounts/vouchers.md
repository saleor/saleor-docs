## How to

### How to add a voucher offer

**1. Enter the Create Voucher view**

Click _Create&nbsp;Voucher_ above the main list on the vouchers page to get started.

**2. Add general information**

There are two options to give your voucher a name:

- Type a name, for example, ‘BlackFridayVoucher’ into the Discount Code field
- Click _Generate&nbsp;Code_ to create a randomized voucher code 

**3. Choose discount type**

Choose if your voucher is:

- Fixed Amount: A specific dollar-amount discount on one or all products
- Percentage: A percentage discount on all products in an order or only the least expensive one
- Free Shipping: No shipping charge for all items in an order

**4. Input voucher value**

Input the fixed amount or percentage discount value of the voucher per channel.

**5. Voucher Specific Information**

Once a voucher has been created, decide whether the fixed-value or percentage-value voucher applies to all products in the order or specific products. If you choose the second option, a new card will appear where you can assign specific categories, collections or products.

You can also enable the only once per order option. If this option is disabled, a discount will be counted for every eligible product.

**6. Apply discount to all products or only full price products**

You can decide if your offer applies to products which are already discounted in other sales or if it only covers full price products. Check the slider to choose the right option.

**6. Set minimum requirements**

Vouchers are a great upselling opportunity. You can choose a minimum order value or quantity of products that customers must reach before the voucher can be applied, or you can choose _None_ and apply the voucher to all products.

**7. Set usage limit**

Choose the total number of vouchers available to all customers. You can create single vouchers for specific customers, a wider offer in limited numbers, or an unlimited number of vouchers for a set period of time.

Choose if each customer (defined by e-mail address) can use the voucher only once or multiple times.

**8. Choose the dates**

Leave the start date blank in the _Active Dates_ card if you want the offer to start immediately. Similarly, leave the end date blank if the voucher will remain valid indefinitely. If the offer is for a specific time, input the start and/or end dates and times.

### How to edit or remove vouchers

Click on any voucher from the main list to edit it. 

To remove vouchers, click the checkbox on the main list and then use the trash can icon, or enter the voucher and click _Delete_ in the footer.
