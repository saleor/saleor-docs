The catalog section contains your entire online inventory. You can view products individually or by category, and can assign products to seasonal collections. Click [[Catalog]] on the left sidebar menu for a drop-down list of sub-sections:

- Products: Add, remove, and edit products, descriptions, and images
- Categories: Gather products by type to make it easier for admins and customers to browse the store
- Collections: Group products from the same or different categories into collections that encourage upselling 


## Categories

Products on the Saleor platform can be sorted by category if you sell a range of items.


### Adding a Category

Click on the [[Add&nbsp;Category]] button to enter a new set of products. Enter the category name, description, and SEO-optimized information the same way as you would with an individual product. When finished, click [[Save&nbsp;Category]] in the bottom right corner and then add a widescreen banner photo that will appear at the top of the screen when customers view the category.

### Editing Categories

Once you have your categories, you can edit them at any time by clicking on a category from the list and changing information. When viewing a category, at the bottom of a section, you have information listing all products in the category, which can be individually clicked and edited, just as in the main products section. 


### Adding Sub-categories

Sub-categories break large groups down into smaller subsets that make it easier to manage stores and help customers find the right products. To add a sub-category, click [[Add&nbsp;Subcategory]] text in the top right corner of the sub-categories box.

In this example, we have paints and cushions in the Accessories category, which can be marked as separate sub-categories. Add a description and SEO information just the same as with a main category.

### Deleting Categories

To remove a category, simply click the [[Delete&nbsp;Category]] button in the footer. 

> **Warning** 
>
> Products are mandatorily assigned to categories. Deleting a category will also remove all products it contains. Only remove a category if you are sure that you also want to permanently delete all its products from your catalog.


## Collections

Collections are a great way to increase sales and give customers better experiences. Group products together to take advantage of seasonal events or link products that are regularly bought in pairs or groups. 


### Creating and Editing Collections

You can add and edit collections in the same way as categories, with a cover photo and SEO content tailored to your collection. To delete individual products, click on the trash can next to the product and confirm removal from the collection.


### Adding Products to Existing Collections

Once you have created a collection, you can easily add more products by choosing the [[Assign&nbsp;Products]] option from the collection overview and choosing products from the list. To find other products, type the name, attribute or product type into the search bar and the list will automatically refresh.

### Featured Collections

- Collections can be easily published and unpublished by clicking on the slider in the Availability section when viewing a specific collection 
- Featuring a collection will make it appear on the front page of your website
- You can only feature one collection at a time. Turning the [[Feature&nbsp;on&nbsp;Homepage]] option on for one collection will automatically turn it off for all others

### Deleting a Collection

There are two ways to remove a collection:

- Click the checkbox next to the collection name on the main list. Options to Publish, Unpublish, and Delete will appear above the list
- Click on the collection name and enter the detailed information, then use the red [[remove]] button in the footer.

Removing a collection will not delete all products from the site; it only disables the grouping of selected products and deletes information about the collection.
