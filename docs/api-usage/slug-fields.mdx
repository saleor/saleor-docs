title: Slug Fields
---

A slug is a short label representing an object or page's content. The main reason for using a slug is the ability to incorporate it into URLs. Translated names can contain all UTF-8 signs, allowing for URLs to be written by people with different keyboard layouts.

Slug can contain:

- letters
- numbers
- underscores
- hyphens

Slugs are translatable in Saleor for product, categories, collections and pages. When using different languages, users can apply the same product URLs regardless of the language or make use translation specific slugs.

The slug can either be passed in mutations or it will be automatically generated by slugifying one of the main fields on the object (e.g. name, title).

## Example

For example: we would like to create a product called "Żółta ćma" ("yellow moth"). The expected slug for such product would be `Zolta-cma`.
