title: Pagination
---

Pagination is required in most queries that return lists of items in the Saleor GraphQL API. It limits the number of results returned by the server to a more manageable size and avoids data flow disruptions.

## Relay specification

Saleor's pagination model is based on the [GraphQL Connection Specification](https://facebook.github.io/relay/graphql/connections.htm) but contains some extra fields added for your convenience.

If your GraphQL client supports **Relay-style pagination**, you can use it with Saleor and skip reading the rest of this page.

- Relay documentation on [pagination](https://relay.dev/docs/guided-tour/list-data/pagination/)

## API reference

Saleor uses **cursor-based** pagination, meaning that each item is assigned a unique cursor instead of page numbers. The API clients can ask for a certain number of items following or preceding a given item.

### Lists vs. connections

There are two types of lists in GraphQL:

- `[Foo]` is a simple list. It is used to query a list containing several items.

  An excellent example of a simple list could be a query for product variants which returns a list with a manageable number of results.

- `FooConnection` represents a more complex list. When queried, it will return an unknown or large number of results.

Pagination is used to help you handle large amounts of items returned by the connection list type.

### &lt;Entity&gt;Connection

```graphql
type ProductCountableConnection {
  edges: [ProductCountableEdge!]!
  pageInfo: PageInfo!
  totalCount: Int
}
```

Each connection contains the following fields:

- `edges`: the list of edges (see below).

- `pageInfo`: information on the pagination result (see below).

In addition to the above, _countable connections_ contain:

- `totalCount`: the total number of items of that type.

  :::caution
  Request `totalCount` sparringly as it is very expensive to calculate.
  :::

### &lt;Entity&gt;Edge

```graphql
type ProductCountableEdge {
  node: Product!
  cursor: String!
}
```

Each node contains the following fields:

- `node`: an individual result (for example, a product).

- `cursor`: the cursor representing the place where the node is located.

### PageInfo

```graphql
type PageInfo {
  hasNextPage: Boolean!
  hasPreviousPage: Boolean!
  startCursor: String
  endCursor: String
}
```

- `hasNextPage`: indicates if there are more items to be fetched. Only calculated for queries using `first`.

- `hasPreviousPage`: indicates if there are items prior to the current page. Only calculated for queries using `last`.

- `startCursor`: the cursor of the first item in `edges`. Use it as `before` to paginate backwards.

- `endCursor`: the cursor of the last item in `edges`. Use it as `after` to paginate forwards.

You can use the `PageInfo` object to know whether the previous or next page exists (`hasPreviousPage`, `hasNextPage`) and how to reach them (`startCursor`, `endCursor`). You can also use individual `cursor` values returned with each node, but it's usually less convenient.

## Fetching paginated data

To indicate how you want the queried items to be selected, use a combination of the following connection arguments:

- `first`: the number of items (nodes) you want the query to return. This argument will return items from the beginning of the list. Cannot be combined with `last`.

  <details>

  <summary>See code example</summary>

  ```graphql
  query {
    // highlight-next-line
    products(first: 10) {
      edges {
        node {
          id
          name
        }
      }
    }
  }
  ```

  </details>

- `last`: the number of items (nodes) you want the query to return. This argument will return items from the end of the list. Cannot be combined with `first`.

  <details>

  <summary>See code example</summary>

  ```graphql
  query {
    // highlight-next-line
    products(last: 10) {
      edges {
        node {
          id
          name
        }
      }
    }
  }
  ```

  </details>

- `after`: the cursor you want to start from. Pass the `cursor` of the last item from the previously fetched chunk and combine it with `first` to paginate through data in equally sized chunks.

  <details>

  <summary>See code example</summary>

  ```graphql
  query {
    // highlight-next-line
    products(first: 10, after: "YXJyYXljb25uZWN0aW9uOjA=") {
      edges {
        node {
          id
          name
        }
      }
    }
  }
  ```

  </details>

- `before`: the cursor you want to end with from. Pass the `cursor` of the first item from the previously fetched chunk and combine it with `last` to paginate through data in equally sized chunks.

  <details>

  <summary>See code example</summary>

  ```graphql
  query {
    // highlight-next-line
    products(last: 10, before: "YXJyYXljb25uZWN0aW9uOjQ==") {
      edges {
        node {
          id
          name
        }
      }
    }
  }
  ```

  </details>

### Example

> You want to display 5 results per page and start with items from the beginning of the list.
>
> 1.  Query the `first: 5` nodes. This becomes your **first page**.
> 2.  If you have more results to show, query the following `first: 5` nodes `after` the node indicated by the value of the cursor of the **fifth node**. This becomes your **second page**.
> 3.  For the **third page**, query the following `first: 5` nodes `after` the node indicated by the cursor of the **tenth node**.
>
> When you want to start displaying the results from the end of the list, you use `last` and `before` respectively.
