# Modeling

## Overview

While Saleor includes standard commerce entities (Products, Categories, Collections), specific business domains often require representing additional concepts (e.g., Brands, Ingredients, [Scent Profiles](./models.mdx#example-use-case)).

Modeling in Saleor refers to the use of built-in features to extend the standard commerce object model. This involves defining custom structured data types and organizational structures, making them queryable via the standard GraphQL API.

The primary mechanisms for domain modeling in Saleor are:

## Models

Models and Attributes enable the definition of custom structured data entities. `REFERENCE` attributes can be used to link entities to each other.

To learn more about Models, refer to the [Models documentation](./models.mdx).

## Structures

Structures function as hierarchical assembly mechanisms for grouping and organizing various entities.

They can link Categories, Collections, Models (including custom Model instances created via modeling), and external URLs into ordered hierarchies.

While commonly applied for storefront navigation, structures can be used for any scenario requiring curated, structured lists or trees of linked entities.

To learn more about Structures, refer to the [Structures documentation](./structures.mdx).
