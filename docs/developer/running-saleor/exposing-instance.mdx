There are situations when you would like to expose your local environment to external clients, for example:

- Show your project to the manager.
- Integrate with the new payment gateway, which requires a return URL.
- Testing app deployed in the cloud.

To achieve that, you need a service for redirecting the traffic. Such service is delivered by [ngrok](https://ngrok.com) and [localtunnel](https://localtunnel.me). Both are great for our use case, and you can choose any of those services.

## Using ngrok

1. Append ngrok URL to `ALLOWED_CLIENT_HOSTS` environment varible
2. Start Saleor on your machine
3. Follow [ngrok installation guide](https://ngrok.com/product)
4. Start a tunnel in your command line `ngrok http 8000`
5. Your server is now exposed under ngrok domain (for example: http://92832de0.ngrok.io). Copy that address.
6. Enter ngrok URL at [Site Settings](dashboard/configuration/site.md) configuration.
