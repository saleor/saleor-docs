## Error reporting

Automated error reporting is not only a way to receive notifications when things go wrong, but it also offers the information necessary to reproduce the problem locally.

### Sentry

Saleor provides integration with [Sentry](https://sentry.io/), a comprehensive error tracking and reporting tool.

To use it, set the following environment variable:

#### `SENTRY_DSN`

Sentry Data Source Name, you can find it in your Sentry project settings.

If you need to customize the service, see the [official Sentry documentation for Django](https://docs.sentry.io/platforms/python/django/) for more details.

## Application performance metrics

Observability is key to understanding a system's behavior. Saleor uses the [OpenTracing](https://opentracing.io/) protocol to report information about its behavior.

What is being traced:

- **HTTP requests** including their duration, full URL, request method, client's IP address, and length of response.
- **GraphQL queries** including their duration, query string, and execution errors.
- **GraphQL resolvers** including their duration, field name, parent type, and execution errors.
- **Database queries** including their duration and the SQL statement.

### Jaeger

[Jaeger](https://www.jaegertracing.io/) is an open-source, end-to-end distributed tracing tool.

If you're using Docker Compose for local development, there is already a Jaeger instance running on your local system. To use Jaeger in your production environment (which we highly recommend), use the following environment variables:

#### `JAEGER_AGENT_HOST`

The hostname the Jaeger agent is listening on.

#### `JAEGER_AGENT_PORT`

The port the Jaeger agent is listening on. Defaults to 6831.

#### `JAEGER_LOGGING`

A boolean flag indicating whether you want to see verbose logs of the agent's communication. Defaults to `False`.
