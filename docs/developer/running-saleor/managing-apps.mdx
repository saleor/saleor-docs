# Commands

Use commands for common apps' operations

## Create app

To create an app from the CLI run following script

```shell
./manage.py create_app
  --identifier my-app
  --permission MANAGE_ORDERS MANAGE_USERS
  --activate
```

It will return app token to stdout. It's useful to create long living tokens too.

## Install app from the Manifest

To install app via Manifest, run:

```shell
./manage.py install_app
 --manifest-url http://localhost:3000/manifest
 --activate
```

# Common issues

## App installation pending infinitely

Common issue with app installations not being resolved is local setup with Celery.

Ensure that [Celery is configured properly](./task-queue.mdx)

Celery will not hot-reload codebase like Uvicorn, so in case of issues try to restart your server.
Pending jobs should be released.
