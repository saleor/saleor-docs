[Saleor platform](https://github.com/mirumee/saleor-platform) uses [Mailhog](https://github.com/mailhog/MailHog) for catching all the emails sent by the Saleor. 

![Mailhog user interface](../screenshots/mailhog.png)

Pros of using Mailhog during development:
- Live preview of rendered emails.
- No need to send emails to external services.
- Test emails will be caught in the local environment, so there is no possibility of sending test data to actual customers.
- Eliminates possibility of sending emails to non existing address, which can hurt email reputation.

## Configuration
