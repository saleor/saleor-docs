Some of the Saleor’s functionality depends on a task queue system to manage asynchronous and periodic tasks. We recommend using Celery with Redis as the message broker.
For more information, please visit [official Celery documentation](https://docs.celeryq.dev/en/stable/index.html). 


## Periodic tasks

Celery Beat is a scheduler that triggers background tasks at regular intervals. 
Some of the Saleor's features can't be used without proper task scheduler setup. In order to start Celery Beat server:

1. Specify `CELERY_BROKER_URL` environmental variable which points to task broker (we recommend using Redis as a broker database), i.e.:

```shell
set CELERY_BROKER_URL="redis://localhost:6379/0"
```

2. Run Celery worker: 

```shell
celery --app saleor.celeryconf:app worker -E --loglevel=info
```

3. As a separate process run Celery Beat: 

```shell
celery --app saleor.celeryconf:app beat --scheduler saleor.schedulers.schedulers.DatabaseScheduler 
```

Below is a list of Saleor features fired up by celery beat with default schedules:
