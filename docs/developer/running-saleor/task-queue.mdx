Some of the Saleorâ€™s functionality depends on a task queue system to manage asynchronous and periodic tasks. We recommend using Celery with Redis as the message broker.
You can use [Saleor Platform](setup/docker-compose.mdx#installation) to get this setup out of the box.
For more information, please visit [official Celery documentation](https://docs.celeryq.dev/en/stable/index.html). 


## Periodic tasks

Celery Beat is a scheduler that triggers background tasks at regular intervals. Below is a list of Saleor features fired up by celery beat with default schedules:

#### Tasks run in intervals:
- Deactivate preorder for variants; 1 hour
- Delete empty allocations; 1 hour
- Delete expired reservations; 1 day
- Delete outdated event data; 1 day
- [Expire orders](developer/checkout/order-expiration.mdx); 5 minutes
- [Recalculate price for catalog promotions](developer/discounts/promotions.mdx#catalogue-promotions); 30 seconds
- [Release funds for abandoned checkouts](developer/checkout/lifecycle.mdx#releasing-funds-for-abandoned-checkouts); 10 minutes
- Remove apps marked as removed; 3 hours
- [Update search vectors](developer/community/contributing.mdx#searching); 20 seconds

#### Tasks run at specific time:
- Deactivate expired gift cards; at 0:00 AM
- [Delete expired checkouts](developer/checkout/lifecycle.mdx#checkout-expiration-and-deletion); at 0:00 AM
- [Delete expired orders](developer/checkout/order-expiration.mdx); at 2:00 AM base on

- Update stocks quantity allocated; once per day at 0:00 AM

It is important to understand that without proper task scheduler setup, the actions above will not be triggered.
