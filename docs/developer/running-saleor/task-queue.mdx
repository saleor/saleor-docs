Some of the Saleorâ€™s functionality depends on a task queue system to manage asynchronous and periodic tasks. We recommend using Celery with Redis as the message broker.
You can use [Saleor Platform](setup/docker-compose.mdx#installation) to get this setup out of the box.
For more information, please visit [official Celery documentation](https://docs.celeryq.dev/en/stable/index.html). 


## Periodic tasks

Celery Beat is a scheduler that triggers background tasks at regular intervals. Below is a list of Saleor features fired up by celery beat with default interval.
