title: Background Tasks
---

Some of the Saleorâ€™s functionality depends on a task queue system to manage asynchronous and periodic tasks. We recommend using Redis as the message broker.
For more information, please visit [official Celery documentation](https://docs.celeryq.dev/en/stable/index.html). 


## Periodic tasks

Saleor uses [Celery Beat](https://docs.celeryq.dev/en/stable/index.html) as a scheduler to trigger background tasks at regular intervals. 
The task scheduler is required for proper operation.

1. Make sure the `CELERY_BROKER_URL` environment variable is set for all services and points to the task broker. Again, we recommend using Redis as a broker database.

```shell
set CELERY_BROKER_URL="<broker url>"
```
An example of the Redis broker url, running on localhost and port 6379, looks like: `redis://localhost:6379/0`.

2. Using the same container image, deploy Celery Workers by overriding the default command with:

```shell
celery --app saleor.celeryconf:app worker -E --loglevel=info
```

3. Deploy exactly one instance of Celery Beat by overriding the default command with: 

```shell
celery --app saleor.celeryconf:app beat --scheduler saleor.schedulers.schedulers.DatabaseScheduler 
```

### Task Schedule
