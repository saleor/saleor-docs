title: Dummy payment
---

## Key concepts
Dummy payment is Saleor testing gateway. It's enabled by default and it does not need
any additional configuration to work. But if you want to customize it, you can do it
through the dashboard (go to `settings/plugins` page and choose dummy from the plugins list).

## Testing for different responses
Below is the list of test card numbers which can be used for checking different responses.
To check response with use of Saleor storefront, just enter one of given card number,
valid expiration date and random CVV value. In case of API you just need to enter
card number as a token value in `CheckoutPaymentCreate` mutation with `mirumee.payments.dummy` set as `gateway`.

Any other card numbers with valid expiration date and random CVV value create a successful payment.

| Card number        | Response                                                              |
