title: Dummy payment
---

## Key concepts

Dummy payment is Saleor testing gateway. It's enabled by default and it does not need
any additional configuration to work. But if you want to customize it, you can do it
through the dashboard (go to `settings/plugins` page and choose dummy from the plugins list).

## Testing for different responses

Below is the list of test card numbers which can be used for checking different responses.
To check response with use of Saleor storefront, just enter one of given card number,
valid expiration date and random CVV value.

Any other card numbers with valid expiration date and random CVV value create a successful payment.

| Card number        | Response                                                              |
| ------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `4000000000000069` | Causes `Card expired` error.                                          |
| `4000000000009995` | Causes `Insufficient funds` error.                                    |
| `4000000000000127` | Causes `Incorrect CVV` error.                                         |
| `4000000000000002` | Causes `Card declined` error.                                         |
| `4111111111111111` | The Card is pre-authorized and causes `Card declined` during capture. |
| `4111111111111112` | The Card is pre-authorized and successfully capture.                  |


### Testing different responses with API

In case of testing dummy payment responses with API you need to have checkout with shipping
and billing address set. See [the checkout page](/developer/checkout.mdx#creating-a-checkout-session)
to know how to create a checkout object.
Then create checkout payment with use of `checkoutPaymentCreate` mutation,
set card number as a `token` value and `mirumee.payments.dummy` as a `gateway`.
To check gateway response use `CheckoutComplete` mutation.
Lets see an example for token which causes `Card expired` error.

Creating checkout payment ([here](/developer/checkout.mdx#selecting-a-payment-method)
you can find more details about `checkoutPaymentCreate`):
```graphql {2-9}
mutation {
    checkoutPaymentCreate(
        input: {
            amount: "15.00"
            gateway: "mirumee.payments.dummy",
            token: "4000000000000069",
        }
        checkoutId: "Q2hlY2tvdXQ6YjIyN2JiNWYtODA4Ny00ZjNlLThhMjYtMzE1OGI4NWE4N2Jh",
    ) {
        payment {
            id
            gateway
            token
        }
        errors {
            field
            message
        }
    }
}
```

We get newly created payment object:
```json
{
  "data": {
    "checkoutPaymentCreate": {
      "payment": {
        "id": "UGF5bWVudDoyMg==",
        "gateway": "mirumee.payments.dummy",
        "token": "4000000000000069",
        "creditCard": null,
        "__typename": "Payment"
      },
      "errors": [],
      "__typename": "CheckoutPaymentCreate"
    }
  }
}
```

Completing checkout and testing gateway response:
```graphql {2-4}
mutation {
  checkoutComplete(
      checkoutId: "Q2hlY2tvdXQ6YjIyN2JiNWYtODA4Ny00ZjNlLThhMjYtMzE1OGI4NWE4N2Jh"
  ) {
      checkoutErrors {
        field
        message
        code
        __typename
      }
      order {
        id
        token
        __typename
      }
      __typename
    }
  }
}
```

As a response, we get error corresponding to the given card number:
```json {7-8}
{
  "data": {
    "checkoutComplete": {
      "checkoutErrors": [
        {
          "field": null,
          "message": "Card expired",
          "code": "PAYMENT_ERROR",
          "__typename": "CheckoutError"
        }
      ],
      "order": null,
      "__typename": "CheckoutComplete"
    }
  }
}
```
