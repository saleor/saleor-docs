title: Shipping Zones
---

## Introduction
Shipping zones allow defining the cost of shipping in different areas of the world.
Shipping zones contains shipping method that are available in given countries and
channels.

Specifying shipping zones is required to allow the selling of products to given countries.

### Shipping zone creation and update
To create the shipping zone use [`shippingZoneCreate`](developer/api-reference/mutations/shipping-zone-create.mdx) mutation.
You can specify such fields as `name`, `description`, `countries`, `warehouses`, `channels` and
decide if the shipping zone should be used as default one for all countries
that are not covered be other zones.

#### Assigning warehouses to the shipping zone
Warehouses that are assignable to shipping zones are the subset of warehouses assigned to the channel.
So, to assign a warehouse to the shipping zone, the warehouse must be available
in at least one channel that the zone is assigned to.
This means that to assign warehouses to the shipping zone, you must first specify
the channels. You can do this during shipping zone creation be providing the
channels and warehouses together.

Below is the example for shipping zone creation with channels and warehouses.
In this case, the defined warehouse is available in the channel defined in `addChannels` field,
so it can be added to this shipping zone.

```graphql {2-12}
mutation {
	shippingZoneCreate(
		input: {
			name: "Zone A"
			description: "Description for shipping zone A."
			countries: ["USD"]
			default: False
			addWarehouses: [
				"V2FyZWhvdXNlOjA4N2I2MzhlLWIxYzYtNDk5Mi1hMWQ1LTZiOWI5N2FjODU1Zg=="
			]
			addChannels: ["Q2hhbm5lbDoxMA=="]
		}
	) {
		shippingZone {
			id
			name
			description
			countries {
				code
			}
			default
			warehouses {
				name
			}
			channels {
				id
			}
		}
		errors {
			field
			code
			message
			channels
			warehouses
		}
	}
}
```

:::note
When adding warehouses to the shipping zone, make sure that all warehouses will have
the common channel with the shipping zone, otherwise you will get the error.
:::

As a result we get the newly created shipping zone.
```json
"data": {
    "shippingZoneCreate": {
        "errors": [],
        "shippingZone": {
            "id": "U2hpcHBpbmdab25lOjEx",
            "name": "Zone A",
            "description": "Description for shipping zone A.",
            "countries": [
                {
                    "code": "USD"
                }
            ],
            "default": False,
            "warehouses": [
                {
                    "name": "ExampleWarehouse"
                }
            ],
            "channels": [
                {
                    "id": "Q2hhbm5lbDoxMg=="
                }
            ]
        }
    }
}
```

To update the shipping zone use [`shippingZoneUpdate`](developer/api-reference/mutations/shipping-zone-update.mdx) mutation.
You can change all fields that you defined during the creation process and also unlink
the channels and warehouses. Be aware that removing the channel may cause unlinking 
warehouses if it was only one common channel between zone and warehouse. 
When adding warehouses, as before, there must be a common channel with the shipping zone.

:::warning
Keep in mind that when the only common channel of warehouse and shipping zone
is deleted (for example after channel deletion or unlinking the warehouse or shipping zone from the channel),
the connection between the warehouse and shipping zone is deleted.
The common channel condition is mandatory.
