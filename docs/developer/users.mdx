## Introduction

This guide describes how to use the Saleor GraphQL API to register a new account as a customer and do everyday account management operations.

## Multiple channels and users

Creating a new account requires specifying a channel. It is needed because you can use different communication strategies for each channel (means of contact, templates used, etc.).

User accounts are not restricted to a single channel. So, for example, a user registered in the `europe` channel can still log in and place an order through the `usa` channel.

## Creating a new customer account

Depending on the configuration of your Saleor backend instance, registering a new customer account may be a single-step operation, or it may require email confirmation when the flag
[`enableAccountConfirmationByEmail`](api-reference/miscellaneous/objects/shop.mdx#code-style-fontweight-normal-shopbenableaccountconfirmationbyemailbcodeboolean-) is set to `True`
When `enableAccountConfirmationByEmail` is set to `True` you can now configure one of the following flows by setting a flag
[`allowLoginWithoutConfirmation`](api-reference/miscellaneous/objects/shop.mdx#code-style-fontweight-normal-shopballowloginwithoutconfirmationbcodeboolean-):

- allow users to log in without email confirmation
- users can only log in after confirming their email

```mermaid
graph TD
  R([Register an account]) --> CR{Confirmation by email enabled?}
  CR -->|No| A([New account is active])
  CR --> |Yes| AL{Allow to log in without confirmation?}
  AL --> |Yes| ANC([New account is active but not confirmed])
  CR -->|No| E[Ask user to check their email]
  E -.-|User clicks link with token| CA[Confirm account using token]
  CA --> C([New account is confirmed])
  C --> A
  ANC --> E
```

### Previous orders

When an account is confirmed, existing anonymous orders using the same email address are automatically assigned to the new account.

### Registration without email confirmation

To create a new customer account, use the `accountRegister` mutation. The mutation takes the following input fields:

- `email`: user's email address.
- `password`: user's password.
- `channel`: the slug of the channel used to sign up.

```graphql {2-4}
mutation {
  accountRegister(
    input: {
      email: "customer@example.com"
      password: "secret"
      channel: "default-channel"
    }
  ) {
    errors {
      field
      code
    }
    user {
      email
      isActive
      isConfirmed
    }
  }
}
```

As a result, we get the data of the newly created user:

```json
{
  "data": {
    "accountRegister": {
      "errors": [],
      "user": {
        "email": "customer@example.com",
        "isActive": true,
        "isConfirmed": false
      }
    }
  }
}
```

The [`isActive`](api-reference/users/objects/user.mdx#code-style-fontweight-normal-userbisactivebcodeboolean--) flag informs that the account is active. If `active` is set to `False` the user can never log in.

The [`isConfirmed`](api-reference/users/objects/user.mdx#code-style-fontweight-normal-userbisconfirmedbcodeboolean--) flag set to `false` means that the account was not confirmed. When you have disabled
[`enableAccountConfirmationByEmail`](api-reference/miscellaneous/objects/shop.mdx#code-style-fontweight-normal-shopbenableaccountconfirmationbyemailbcodeboolean-), `isConfirmed` doesn't hold any meaning for users, they are treated as confirmed.
The only difference is that in the confirmation flow, the user can get access to past orders, see [Previous orders](#previous-orders).

Examples above include `errors` field, which may return any [data-level errors](api-usage/error-handling.mdx#data-level-errors). Here is a response that would be returned if there is already an account registered for the given email:

```json
{
  "data": {
    "accountRegister": {
      "errors": [
        {
          "field": "email",
          "code": "UNIQUE"
        }
      ],
      "user": null
    }
  }
}
```

### Registration with email confirmation

Registering an account with email confirmation consists of two steps, and it requires you to have a storefront view, where users will be redirected to confirm their email.
First, you need to use the `accountRegister` mutation to create an inactive account and send an email with the confirmation link.
The mutation takes the following input fields:

- `email`: user's email address.
- `password`: user's password.
- `redirectUrl`: path to a view where the user should be redirected to confirm their email.
- `channel`: the slug of the channel used to sign up.

This example assumes that you're running the storefront locally with the default settings (running on port `3001`):

```graphql {2-8}
mutation {
  accountRegister(
    input: {
      email: "customer@example.com"
      password: "secret"
      redirectUrl: "http://localhost:3001/account-confirm/"
      channel: "default-channel"
    }
  ) {
    errors {
      field
      code
    }
    user {
      email
      isActive
      isConfirmed
    }
  }
}
```

As a result, we get the data of the newly created but yet inactive user:

```json
{
  "data": {
    "accountRegister": {
      "errors": [],
      "user": {
        "email": "customer@example.com",
        "isActive": true,
        "isConfirmed": false
      }
    }
  }
}
```

At the same time, the user `customer@example.com` should receive an email with a confirmation link based on the provided `redirectUrl` path, for example:

```
http://localhost:3001/account-confirm/?email=customer%40example.com&token=5fc-9f2116f96bdafd612cf4
```

The link contains two query parameters—`email` and `token` — which are required to proceed with the second mutation, `confirmAccount`:

```graphql {2-5}
mutation {
  confirmAccount(
    email: "customer@example.com"
    token: "5fc-9f2116f96bdafd612cf4"
  ) {
    errors {
      field
      code
    }
    user {
      email
      isActive
      isConfirmed
    }
  }
}
```

If the token is valid, the user will be successfully confirmed:

```json
{
  "data": {
    "confirmAccount": {
      "errors": [],
      "user": {
        "email": "customer@example.com",
        "isActive": true,
        "isConfirmed": true
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## Re-requesting email confirmation

Resending email confirmation requires you to have a storefront view, where users will be redirected to confirm their email.
You need to use the `sendConfirmationEmail` mutation to send an email with the confirmation link.
The mutation takes the following input fields:

- `redirectUrl`: path to a view where the user should be redirected to confirm their email.
- `channel`: the slug of the channel used to sign up.

This example assumes that you're running the storefront locally with the default settings (running on port `3001`):

```graphql {2-8}
mutation {
  sendConfirmationEmail(
    redirectUrl: "http://localhost:3001/account-confirm/"
    channel: "default-channel"
  ) {
    errors {
      field
      code
    }
  }
}
```

This mutation requires the caller to be [authenticated](api-usage/authentication.mdx).

At the same time, the authenticated user should receive an email with a confirmation link based on the provided `redirectUrl` path, for example:

```
http://localhost:3001/account-confirm/?email=customer%40example.com&token=5fc-9f2116f96bdafd612cf4
```

The link contains two query parameters—`email` and `token` — which are required to proceed with the second mutation, `confirmAccount`:

```graphql {2-5}
mutation {
  confirmAccount(
    email: "customer@example.com"
    token: "5fc-9f2116f96bdafd612cf4"
  ) {
    errors {
      field
      code
    }
    user {
      email
      isActive
      isConfirmed
    }
  }
}
```

If the token is valid, the user will be successfully confirmed:

```json
{
  "data": {
    "confirmAccount": {
      "errors": [],
      "user": {
        "email": "customer@example.com",
        "isActive": true,
        "isConfirmed": true
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## Resetting the password

Resetting the password is a two-step operation. First, you need to call a mutation to send an email with a unique link to reset the password.

The mutation takes the following input fields:

- `email`: user's email address.
- `redirectUrl`: path to a view where the user should be redirected to reset the password.

```graphql {2-5}
mutation {
  requestPasswordReset(
    email: "customer@example.com"
    redirectUrl: "http://localhost:3001/reset-password/"
  ) {
    errors {
      field
      code
    }
  }
}
```

As a result, if there are no errors in the response, the system sends an email to `customer@example.com` with a link to provide a new password, for example:

```
http://localhost:3001/reset-password/?email=customer%40example.com&token=5fc-9f2116f96bdafd612cf4
```

The link contains two query parameters—`email` and `token`—which are required to proceed with the second mutation, `setPassword`.

The mutation takes the following input fields:

- `token`: a unique token that was included in the link in the email.
- `email`: user's email address.
- `password`: the new password.

```graphql {2-6}
mutation {
  setPassword(
    token: "5fc-9f2116f96bdafd612cf4"
    email: "customer@example.com"
    password: "new-secret"
  ) {
    errors {
      field
      code
    }
  }
}
```

If there are no errors in the response, the password is successfully changed.

## Changing the password

If you wish to change your password as an authenticated customer, use the `passwordChange` mutation. The mutation takes the following input fields:

- `oldPassword`: the current user's password.
- `newPassword`: the new password.

```graphql {2}
mutation {
  passwordChange(oldPassword: "secret", newPassword: "new-secret") {
    errors {
      field
      code
    }
  }
}
```

If no errors are returned, the password has been changed successfully.

This mutation requires the caller to be [authenticated](api-usage/authentication.mdx).

## Changing the email address

Changing the email address of the existing user accounts is a two-step operation. First, you need to call the `requestEmailChange` mutation.

The mutation takes the following input fields:

- `newEmail`: the new email address to set for the account.
- `password`: the current user's password.
- `redirectUrl`: path to a view where the user should be redirected to confirm the new email address.

```graphql {2-6}
mutation {
  requestEmailChange(
    newEmail: "new-address@example.com"
    password: "secret"
    redirectUrl: "http://localhost:3001/confirm-email/"
  ) {
    errors {
      field
      code
    }
    user {
      email
    }
  }
}
```

If there are no errors, the mutation sends an email to the `newEmail` address with a link to confirm the operation. In this example, we also return the `email` of the current user. As you can see in the response below, the email hasn't been updated yet.

```json
{
  "data": {
    "requestEmailChange": {
      "errors": [],
      "user": {
        "email": "admin@example.com"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

The confirmation links include an additional query-string parameter `token` which is required to confirm the operation, e.g.:

```
http://localhost:3001/confirm-email/?token=eyJ0eXAiOiJKV1QiLCJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiJ9.eyJleHAiOjE1ODYxNzY5OTQsIm9sZF9lbWFpbCI6ImFkbWluQGV4YW1wbGUuY29tIiwibmV3X2VtYWlsIjoibmV3LWFkZHJlc3NAZXhhbXBsZS5jb20iLCJ1c2VyX3BrIjoyMX0.aGAo28Ss_zOn_TwAzLCXdY1xENpf_-uw2khORoodKR8
```

To confirm the operation, we need to use the `confirmEmailChange` mutation, which accepts the following input:

- `token`: a unique token that was included in the link in the email.

```graphql {2-4}
mutation {
  confirmEmailChange(
    token: "eyJ0eXAiOiJKV1QiLCJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiJ9.eyJleHAiOjE1ODYxNzY5OTQsIm9sZF9lbWFpbCI6ImFkbWluQGV4YW1wbGUuY29tIiwibmV3X2VtYWlsIjoibmV3LWFkZHJlc3NAZXhhbXBsZS5jb20iLCJ1c2VyX3BrIjoyMX0.aGAo28Ss_zOn_TwAzLCXdY1xENpf_-uw2khORoodKR8"
  ) {
    errors {
      field
      code
    }
    user {
      email
    }
  }
}
```

If the token is valid the email should be now updated:

```json
{
  "data": {
    "confirmEmailChange": {
      "errors": [],
      "user": {
        "email": "new-address@example.com"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Both mutations require the caller to be [authenticated](api-usage/authentication.mdx).

## Deleting the account

If you wish to remove your own customer account, you can do so by using two mutations. First, you need to request to delete your account with the `accountRequestDeletion` mutation. This mutation takes the following input:

- `redirectUrl`: path to a view where the user can confirm deleting the account.

```graphql {2}
mutation {
  accountRequestDeletion(redirectUrl: "http://localhost:3001/confirm-delete/") {
    errors {
      field
      message
      code
    }
  }
}
```

As a result, if there are no errors, the user receives an email with a link to confirm deleting their account. The link includes the `token` query parameter that is required in the second mutation:

```
http://localhost:3001/confirm-delete/?token=5ff-b5818345d8b64331b068
```

To confirm deleting the account, use the `accountDelete` mutation which accepts the following input:

- `token`: a unique token that was included in the link in the email.

```graphql {2}
mutation {
  accountDelete(token: "5ff-b5818345d8b64331b068") {
    errors {
      field
      message
      code
    }
  }
}
```

As a result, the account is now deleted.

Both mutations require the caller to be [authenticated](api-usage/authentication.mdx).
