title: Apollo Federation
---

[Apollo Federation](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/federation/) is a specification for GraphQL servers to implement to enable combining multiple services into single GraphQL API. It is also an extension for [Apollo Server](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/apollo-server/) that performs this combining. GraphQL server combining multiple services into one is called "gateway" in GraphQL world.

## Federation support in Saleor

Saleor supports Apollo Federation. Types that can be used in federated relations are part of the [`_Entity` union](/developer/api-reference/unions/entity.mdx).

Most types in schema use their ID attribute for key, but the `User` type supports both `id` and `email` which `Product`, `ProductVariant` and `Collection` use composite keys made of `id` and `channel` slug:

| type              | key           | alternative key   |
|-------------------|---------------|-------------------|
| `Address`         | `id`          |                   |
| `App`             | `id`          |                   |
| `Category`        | `id`          |                   |
| `Collection`      | `id channel`  |                   |
| `Group`           | `id`          |                   |
| `PageType`        | `id`          |                   |
| `Product`         | `id channel`  |                   |
| `ProductMedia`    | `id`          |                   |
| `ProductType`     | `id`          |                   |
| `ProductVariant`  | `id channel`  |                   |
| `User`            | `id`          | `email`           |

## Known issues and limitations

Apollo Federation doesn't handle the scenario when federated server didn't return the requested object [too well](https://github.com/apollographql/federation/issues/376). GraphQL gateway will report an error when Saleor fails to return requested entity, either because it was deleted, request is missing authorization required to retrieve it or it's ID was incorrect.

Rely on webhooks to update or clear relations stored in your service's database when objects are deleted in Saleor.

Different types can require different permissions to retrieve by federation and two users may don't have access to same objects of same type. Resolvers implemented by your service that return keys for federation may require implementation additional checks. Likewise some data (eg. review's authors names) is better duplicated across services and kept in sync with webhooks instead being queried over the federation.

In some cases it may be required to setup an application account in your store's dashboard, and configure your gateway server to use application credentials when communicating with Saleor GraphQL API.
