## How Saleor Selects Shipping Methods
When a customer reaches the shipping step in checkout, or when you edit an order (draft or unconfirmed), 
Saleor builds the list of available shipping methods. It applies built-in rules, optionally applies app-driven logic via webhooks.

### Built-in Shipping Methods

1. Channel and zone prerequisites
   - The checkout/order channel must have at least one shipping zone assigned.
   - The shipping address country must be assigned inside at least one of those shipping zones.
   - See: [Shipping Zones](/developer/shipping/shipping-zone.mdx).

2. Shipping methods channel availability
   - Shipping methods are channel-specific. A method must be listed for the same channel.
   - See: [Shipping Methods](/developer/shipping/shipping-method.mdx).

3. Method conditions
   - Product exclusions: methods that exclude any product present in the checkout/order are removed.
   - Price-based methods: kept only if the channel subtotal is within the method’s min/max order price.
   - Weight-based methods: kept only if the total weight is within the method’s min/max order weight.
   - Postal code rules: include/exclude rules are checked against the shipping address postal code.

### External Shipping Methods for Checkout’s

Apps can provide additional methods in real time:

1. Subscribe the app to `SHIPPING_LIST_METHODS_FOR_CHECKOUT`.
2. Saleor sends checkout context (addresses, lines, channel, currency).
3. The app returns methods with prices; Saleor merges them with built-in methods.

- The returned `currency` must match the checkout currency.
- Details and payload/response examples: [Shipping webhooks](/developer/extending/webhooks/synchronous-events/shipping.mdx#list-external-shipping-methods).

### Filtering Shipping Methods

After collecting candidates, Saleor can call filtering webhooks so apps can disable methods per business rules:

- `CHECKOUT_FILTER_SHIPPING_METHODS`: when listing methods for a checkout.
- `ORDER_FILTER_SHIPPING_METHODS`: when listing methods for an editable order (draft or unconfirmed).

An app may:
- Mark a method as inactive (`active = false`).
- Provide a `message` explaining why a method is unavailable.

See examples and guidance: [Filter shipping methods](/developer/extending/webhooks/synchronous-events/shipping.mdx#filter-shipping-methods).

## Example: Multiple Zones Matching One Address
If a country is assigned to more than one shipping zone, Saleor will aggregate all applicable shipping methods from all matching zones.

**Zones:**

- Zone **Benelux**: Belgium, Netherlands, Luxembourg → Methods:  _Standard, Express_
- Zone **All EU** (including BE, NL, LU): → Methods: _Economy, Courier_

**Checkout:** Address in Netherlands, subtotal €40

**Result:** All four methods (Standard, Express, Economy, Courier) are returned.

:::info
- Saleor does not stop at the first zone → all matching zones contribute methods.
- Methods are then filtered by channel, currency, product exclusions, price/weight, and postal code rules.
- Final list is sorted by price, regardless of zone.
