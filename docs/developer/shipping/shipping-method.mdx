# Shipping Methods

Shipping Methods define the available delivery options and their associated costs within a specific shipping zone.
They define how much customers pay, what carriers you use, and under what conditions each method applies.

Saleor supports two types of shipping methods:
- **Price-based**: These methods are available when the order total falls 
within the configured minimum and/or maximum price range.
- **Weight-based**: These methods are available when the order's total weight falls 
within the configured minimum and/or maximum weight range.


:::note
In Saleor, **Shipping Methods** and **Shipping Rates** refer to the same concept. 
When creating them in the dashboard, they are called Shipping Rates, 
while in the API responses they are returned as Shipping Methods.

For details on using webhooks to integrate external shipping methods, or filtering build-in methods
see the [Shipping webhooks chapter](/developer/extending/webhooks/synchronous-events/shipping.mdx). 
Additionally, information on how shipping methods are listed 
and used during the checkout process can be found in the 
[Listing available shipping methods](/developer/checkout/address.mdx#listing-available-shipping-methods)
 in checkout guide.

## Creating Shipping Methods
:::info
Creating shipping methods requires the `MANAGE_SHIPPING` permission.
:::

You can select if particular shipping method should be available for each channel assigned to shipping zone. 
This allows you to have different shipping options available in different sales channels, 
even within the same shipping zone.

You can create shipping zones either via the Saleor Dashboard or using the GraphQL API.

### Saleor Dashboard

1. Go to Configuration → Shipping Zones
2. Select the shipping zone you want to configure
3. Click "Create Rate" next to the appropriate section (**Price Based Rates** or **Weight Based Rates**)
4. Add at least a name and price for sales channel(s)
5. Save Shipping Method


### Price-Based Methods

Price-based shipping methods allow you to set different price restrictions for each channel. 
This means you can have different minimum and maximum order values for the same shipping method across different sales channels. 
For example, you might want to offer free shipping for orders over $100 in your main store, 
but require a minimum order of $50 in your marketplace channel.

1. Use the [`shippingPriceCreate`](/api-reference/shipping/mutations/shipping-price-create.mdx) 
mutation with `"type": "PRICE"`:

    ```graphql {2-9}
    mutation {
      shippingPriceCreate(
        input: {
          shippingZone: "U2hpcHBpbmdab25lOjE4", 
          type: PRICE, 
          name: "Post Office", 
          minimumDeliveryDays: 2, 
          maximumDeliveryDays: 7
        }
      ) {
        errors {
          field
          code
          message
        }
        shippingMethod {
          id
          type
          name
          minimumDeliveryDays
          maximumDeliveryDays
          minimumOrderWeight {
            value
            unit
          }
          maximumOrderWeight {
            value
            unit
          }
          channelListings {
            channel {
              slug
            }
            minimumOrderPrice {
              amount
            }
            maximumOrderPrice {
              amount
            }
            price {
              amount
            }
          }
        }
      }
    }
    ```

2. Make the shipping method available in channels using 
[`shippingMethodChannelListingUpdate`](/api-reference/shipping/mutations/shipping-method-channel-listing-update.mdx):

    ```graphql {2-9}
    mutation {
      shippingMethodChannelListingUpdate(
        id: "U2hpcHBpbmdNZXRob2RUeXBlOjM3"
        input: {
          addChannels: [{
            channelId: "Q2hhbm5lbDo1NA==", 
            maximumOrderPrice: 1000, 
            price: 9.99}]
        }
      ) {
        errors {
          field
          code
          message
        }
        shippingMethod {
          id
          type
          name
          minimumDeliveryDays
          maximumDeliveryDays
          minimumOrderWeight {
            value
            unit
          }
          maximumOrderWeight {
            value
            unit
          }
          channelListings {
            channel {
              slug
            }
            minimumOrderPrice {
              amount
            }
            maximumOrderPrice {
              amount
            }
            price {
              amount
            }
          }
        }
      }
    }
    ```

### Weight-Based Methods

Weight-based shipping methods have a global weight restriction that applies to all channels. 
This means the minimum and maximum weight limits you set will be the same regardless of which channel the order comes from. 
This is particularly useful when you need to ensure consistent shipping rules based on physical constraints, 
like package size or carrier limitations.

1. First, set the default weight unit for your store. By default, it is set to KG, 
so if you operate using a different unit (e.g., LB), make sure to update it accordingly.
See the list of [spported weight units](/api-reference/miscellaneous/enums/weight-units-enum.mdx).

    You can update the unit in the Dashboard by going to the Shipping Zones list 
    and clicking the settings icon in the top-right corner, or by using the mutation below:

    ```graphql {2}
    mutation {
      shopSettingsUpdate(input: {defaultWeightUnit: G}) {
        errors {
          code
          field
          message
        }
        shop {
          defaultWeightUnit
        }
      }
    }
    ```

2. Use the [`shippingPriceCreate`](/api-reference/shipping/mutations/shipping-price-create.mdx) 
mutation with `"type": "WEIGHT"`, additionally you can specify weight range with `minimumOrderWeight` and `maximumOrderWeight`

    ```graphql {2-11}
    mutation {
      shippingPriceCreate(
        input: {
          shippingZone: "U2hpcHBpbmdab25lOjE4", 
          type: WEIGHT, 
          name: "Post Office", 
          minimumDeliveryDays: 2, 
          maximumDeliveryDays: 7, 
          minimumOrderWeight: 2, 
          maximumOrderWeight: 20
        }
      ) {
        errors {
          field
          code
          message
        }
        shippingMethod {
          id
          type
          name
          minimumDeliveryDays
          maximumDeliveryDays
          minimumOrderWeight {
            value
            unit
          }
          maximumOrderWeight {
            value
            unit
          }
          channelListings {
            channel {
              slug
            }
            minimumOrderPrice {
              amount
            }
            maximumOrderPrice {
              amount
            }
            price {
              amount
            }
          }
        }
      }
    }
    ```

3. Make the shipping method available in channels using 
[`shippingMethodChannelListingUpdate`](/api-reference/shipping/mutations/shipping-method-channel-listing-update.mdx):

    ```graphql {2-8}
    mutation {
      shippingMethodChannelListingUpdate(
        id: "U2hpcHBpbmdNZXRob2RUeXBlOjM5"
        input: {
          addChannels: [{
            channelId: "Q2hhbm5lbDo1NA==", 
            price: 9.99}]
        }
      ) {
        errors {
          field
          code
          message
        }
        shippingMethod {
          id
          type
          name
          minimumDeliveryDays
          maximumDeliveryDays
          minimumOrderWeight {
            value
            unit
          }
          maximumOrderWeight {
            value
            unit
          }
          channelListings {
            channel {
              slug
            }
            minimumOrderPrice {
              amount
            }
            maximumOrderPrice {
              amount
            }
            price {
              amount
            }
          }
        }
      }
    }
    ```

## Advanced Configuration

### Postal Code Rules

You can configure postal code rules to control where shipping methods are available:

- **Exclude postal codes**: Added postal codes will be excluded from using this delivery method. If none are added, all postal codes will be able to use that shipping rate.
- **Include postal codes**: Only added postal codes will be able to use this shipping rate.

Configure postal codes using the [`shippingPriceUpdate`](/api-reference/shipping/mutations/shipping-price-update.mdx) 
mutation, below example shows how to exclude one postal code for existing shipping method:

```graphql {2-7}
mutation {
  shippingPriceUpdate(
    id: "U2hpcHBpbmdNZXRob2RUeXBlOjE1"
    input: {
      addPostalCodeRules: [{end: "", start: "83-330"}], 
      deletePostalCodeRules: [], 
      inclusionType: EXCLUDE
    }
  ) {
    errors {
      field
      code
      message
    }
    shippingMethod {
      postalCodeRules {
        id
        start
        end
        inclusionType
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### Product Exclusions

You can exclude specific products from using certain shipping methods.

- Use [`shippingPriceExcludeProducts`](/api-reference/shipping/mutations/shipping-price-exclude-products.mdx) 
to add products to the exclusion list
- Use [`shippingPriceRemoveProductFromExclude`](/api-reference/shipping/mutations/shipping-price-remove-product-from-exclude.mdx) 
to remove products from the exclusion list

Here is example for excluding products:
```graphql {2-4}
mutation {
  shippingPriceExcludeProducts(
    id: "U2hpcHBpbmdNZXRob2RUeXBlOjE1"
    input: {products: ["UHJvZHVjdDoxNDQ="]}
  ) {
    errors {
      field
      code
      message
    }
    shippingMethod {
      excludedProducts {
        totalCount
        edges {
          node {
            slug
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```
### Delivery Time Estimates

Configure delivery time estimates to help customers choose the right shipping method:

```graphql
{
  "maximumDeliveryDays": 7,
  "minimumDeliveryDays": 2
}
```

### Tax Configuration

You can assign a tax class to shipping methods. For more information, see the 
[taxes guide](/developer/taxes.mdx#shipping-tax-rate).

## Managing Shipping Methods

### Updating

Update existing shipping methods using:
- [`shippingPriceUpdate`](/api-reference/shipping/mutations/shipping-price-update.mdx)
 Use this mutation for general updates to the shipping method's name, delivery days, etc.
- [`shippingMethodChannelListingUpdate`](/api-reference/shipping/mutations/shipping-method-channel-listing-update.mdx)
 Use this mutation to adjust channel-specific settings like price and order total range.
- [`shippingPriceTranslate`](/api-reference/miscellaneous/inputs/shipping-price-translation-input.mdx)
 Use this mutation to provide translations for the shipping method's name and description in different languages.

### Metadata Management

To manage shipping rate metadata, use:
- [`updateMetadata`](/api-reference/miscellaneous/mutations/update-metadata.mdx)
- [`updatePrivateMetadata`](/api-reference/miscellaneous/mutations/update-private-metadata.mdx)

### Deleting

Remove shipping methods using:
- [`shippingPriceDelete`](/api-reference/shipping/mutations/shipping-price-delete.mdx) for single deletion
- [`shippingPriceBulkDelete`](/api-reference/shipping/mutations/shipping-price-bulk-delete.mdx) for bulk deletion

## Webhooks

Saleor provides the following webhooks for shipping methods:

- `SHIPPING_PRICE_CREATED`: Triggered when a new shipping method is created
- `SHIPPING_PRICE_DELETED`: Triggered when a shipping method is deleted
- `SHIPPING_PRICE_UPDATED`: Triggered when a shipping method is updated

For more information on setting up webhooks, refer to the [webhook chapter](/developer/extending/webhooks/overview.mdx).

For details on using webhooks to integrate external shipping methods, or filtering build-in methods
see the [Shipping webhooks chapter](/developer/extending/webhooks/synchronous-events/shipping.mdx).
