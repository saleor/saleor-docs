Shipping Zones define geographical areas where specific shipping methods and rates apply. 
They enable merchants to set different shipping rules for various regions,
ensuring accurate delivery options and costs for customers. 
Shipping zones are essential for selling physical products internationally.

## Creating Shipping Zones
:::info
Creating shipping zones require `MANAGE_SHIPPING` permission. 
:::
You can create shipping zones either via the Saleor Dashboard or using the GraphQL API.

### Saleor Dashboard
1. Go to Configuration → Shipping Zones.
2. Click Create Shipping Zone.
3. Fill in the following details:
    - Name: A descriptive label for the zone.
    - Countries: Select the countries to include in this zone.
:::note
When creating a Shipping Zone, selecting **Rest of the World** 
automatically includes all countries that are not yet assigned to any other shipping zone.

This option simplifies global configuration by dynamically selecting unassigned countries.
:::
4. Save new Shipping Zone.

Once a shipping zone is created, you can assign channels, warehouses, and define shipping methods.

### API

To create a shipping zone programmatically, use the [`shippingZoneCreate`](/api-reference/shipping/mutations/shipping-zone-create.mdx)
mutation. This mutation allows you to:
- Set the zone's name and description
- Assign countries to the zone
- Link the zone to specific channels and warehouses 
- Setting `default: true` to automatically assign all unassigned countries to this shipping zone

```graphql {2-10}
mutation {
  shippingZoneCreate(
    input: {
      name: "Zone A", 
      description: "Description for shipping zone A.", 
      countries: ["US"], 
      default: false, 
      addWarehouses: ["V2FyZWhvdXNlOjc1MjYwYWRjLTJjZjAtNGQ0ZC1hOTM5LTBmZGY2Y2FlYjBjMQ=="], 
      addChannels: ["Q2hhbm5lbDox"]
    }
  ) {
    shippingZone {
      id
      name
      description
      countries {
        code
      }
      default
      warehouses {
        name
      }
      channels {
        id
      }
    }
    errors {
      field
      code
      message
      channels
      warehouses
    }
  }
}
```

## Updating Shipping Zone
To make changes to an existing shipping zone, you can use the [`shippingZoneUpdate`](api-reference/shipping/mutations/shipping-zone-update.mdx) 
mutation. This allows you to modify any of the settings established during the zone's creation, as well as to detach channels and warehouses.

To manage shipping zone metadata, use [`updateMetadata`](/api-reference/miscellaneous/mutations/update-metadata.mdx) 
or [`updatePrivateMetadata`](/api-reference/miscellaneous/mutations/update-private-metadata.mdx). 

### Assigning warehouses to the shipping zone

Warehouses that are assignable to shipping zones are the subset of warehouses assigned to the channel.
So, to assign a warehouse to the shipping zone, the warehouse must be available in at least one channel to which the zone is assigned.
Thus, you must first specify the channels to assign warehouses to the shipping zone. You can do this by providing the channels and warehouses together during shipping zone creation.


Assign warehouse to shipping zone can be done via the Saleor Dashboard or using the GraphQL API.

#### Saleor Dashboard
1. Go to Configuration → Shipping Zones.
2. Select the shipping zone you want to configure.
3. On the right panel, find the Warehouses section.
4. Click to open the dropdown, select a warehouse by name or search.
5. Save Shipping Zone.

#### API

Use the [`shippingZoneUpdate`](/api-reference/shipping/mutations/shipping-zone-update.mdx) 
mutation to add a warehouse to a shipping zone.
```graphql {2-8}
mutation {
  shippingZoneUpdate(
    id: "U2hpcHBpbmdab25lOjM="
    input: {
      addWarehouses: ["V2FyZWhvdXNlOjNiN2FlMmVhLWEzMDQtNGFiZS1hY2QzLWVlZWU3ZDIxNmMyYw=="]
    }
  ) {
    shippingZone {
      id
      name
      description
      countries {
        code
      }
      default
      warehouses {
        name
      }
      channels {
        id
      }
    }
    errors {
      field
      code
      message
      channels
      warehouses
    }
  }
}
```

:::note
When adding warehouses to the shipping zone, make sure that all warehouses will have
the common channel with the shipping zone, otherwise you will get an error.

## Webhooks
- `SHIPPING_ZONE_CREATED`: Triggered when a new shipping zone is created. Useful for initializing shipping configurations in external systems or triggering setup workflows.
- `SHIPPING_ZONE_UPDATED`: Triggered when a shipping zone is modified, including changes to countries, channels, or warehouses. Helps ensure synchronization with external shipping services.
- `SHIPPING_ZONE_DELETED`: Triggered when a shipping zone is deleted. Can be used to clean up or archive related shipping data in connected systems.
- `SHIPPING_ZONE_METADATA_UPDATED`: Triggered when metadata for a shipping zone is updated. Useful for tracking custom attributes or triggering actions based on metadata changes.

For more information on setting up webhooks, refer to the [webhook chapter](/developer/extending/webhooks/overview.mdx).

For details on using webhooks to integrate external shipping methods, or filtering build-in methods
see the [Shipping webhooks chapter](/developer/extending/webhooks/synchronous-events/shipping.mdx).
