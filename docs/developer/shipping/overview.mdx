## Shipping zone configuration

Shipping zones allow defining the cost of shipping in different areas of the world.
Shipping zones contain shipping methods that are available in given countries and
channels.

Shipping zones are required to sell physical products to given countries.

### Shipping zone creation and update

To create the shipping zone use [`shippingZoneCreate`](api-reference/shipping/mutations/shipping-zone-create.mdx) mutation.
You can specify such fields as `name`, `description`, `countries`, `warehouses`, `channels` and
decide if you want to use it as the default one for all countries
that are not covered by other zones.

### Assigning warehouses to the shipping zone

Warehouses that are assignable to shipping zones are the subset of warehouses assigned to the channel.
So, to assign a warehouse to the shipping zone, the warehouse must be available in at least one channel to which the zone is assigned.
Thus, you must first specify the channels to assign warehouses to the shipping zone. You can do this by providing the channels and warehouses together during shipping zone creation.

Below is the example for shipping zone creation with channels and warehouses.
In this case, the defined warehouse is available in the channel specified in `addChannels` field, so it can be added to this shipping zone.

```graphql {2-12}
mutation {
  shippingZoneCreate(
    input: {
      name: "Zone A"
      description: "Description for shipping zone A."
      countries: ["US"]
      default: False
      addWarehouses: [
        "V2FyZWhvdXNlOjA4N2I2MzhlLWIxYzYtNDk5Mi1hMWQ1LTZiOWI5N2FjODU1Zg=="
      ]
      addChannels: ["Q2hhbm5lbDoxMA=="]
    }
  ) {
    shippingZone {
      id
      name
      description
      countries {
        code
      }
      default
      warehouses {
        name
      }
      channels {
        id
      }
    }
    errors {
      field
      code
      message
      channels
      warehouses
    }
  }
}
```

:::note
When adding warehouses to the shipping zone, make sure that all warehouses will have
the common channel with the shipping zone, otherwise you will get an error.
:::

As a result, we get the newly created shipping zone.

```json
"data": {
  "shippingZoneCreate": {
    "errors": [],
    "shippingZone": {
      "id": "U2hpcHBpbmdab25lOjEx",
      "name": "Zone A",
      "description": "Description for shipping zone A.",
      "countries": [
        {
          "code": "USD"
        }
      ],
      "default": False,
      "warehouses": [
        {
          "name": "ExampleWarehouse"
        }
      ],
      "channels": [
        {
          "id": "Q2hhbm5lbDoxMg=="
        }
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

To update the shipping zone use [`shippingZoneUpdate`](api-reference/shipping/mutations/shipping-zone-update.mdx) mutation.
You can change all fields you defined during the creation process and unlink the channels and warehouses. Be aware that removing the channel may cause unlinking warehouses if it was the only common channel between zone and warehouse.
As before, adding warehouses must have a common channel with the shipping zone.

:::warning
Keep in mind that when the only common channel of warehouse and shipping zone is deleted (for example, after channel deletion or unlinking the warehouse or shipping zone from the channel),
the connection between the warehouse and shipping zone is deleted.
The common channel condition is mandatory.
