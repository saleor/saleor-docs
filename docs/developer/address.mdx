title: Address Validation
---

Address format varies between each country. Saleor has a backend validation library that helps you gather data required by postal services.

:::note

Validation is only performed on the format of address data. To check if the address exists or get the address auto-complete, use services like [Shippo](https://goshippo.com/) or [Loqate](https://www.loqate.com/en-us/).

:::

## Validation rules

Using the [addressValidationRules](api-reference/users/queries/address-validation-rules.mdx) query, API clients can fetch validation rules depending on the selected country. Based on the ruleset, some address fields can be hidden (e.g. `countryArea`).
Saleor Core uses [Google i18n address](https://github.com/mirumee/google-i18n-address) under the hood, with a ruleset from [Google Address Data](https://chromium-i18n.appspot.com/ssl-address).

```graphql
query {
  addressValidationRules(countryCode: PL) {
    countryName
    allowedFields
    requiredFields
    countryAreaType
  }
}
```

Response:

```json
{
  "data": {
    "addressValidationRules": {
      "countryName": "POLAND",
      "allowedFields": [
        "city",
        "streetAddress1",
        "postalCode",
        "streetAddress2",
        "companyName",
        "name"
      ],
      "requiredFields": ["streetAddress1", "city", "postalCode"],
      "countryAreaType": "province"
    }
  }
}
```

Depending on the country, not all `allowedFields` fields are necessary. Nevertheless, additional info can be helpful for postal services.

### Valid address items extension

Saleor gives an option to extend the ruleset from [Google Address Data](https://chromium-i18n.appspot.com/ssl-address) and process custom address names.
There is a `VALID_ADDRESS_EXTENSION_MAP` embedded in core repository, which can be utilized to link custom names with the valid ones.

Ie. `Dublin` is an invalid `countryArea` in accordance to Google Address Data ruleset. The correct value is `Co. Dublin`. By providing
a proper mapping, the value `Dublin` will be recognized as a valid country area and converted to `Co. Dublin`.

## Setting up the address using the API

As an example of the address validation API, we will set the billing address in the checkout. The operation can be made with [checkoutBillingAddressUpdate](api-reference/checkout/mutations/checkout-billing-address-update.mdx):

```graphql
mutation {
  checkoutBillingAddressUpdate(
    billingAddress: {
      country: PL
      firstName: "John"
      lastName: "Smith"
      streetAddress1: "ul. Tęczowa 7"
      postalCode: "53-030"
      city: "Wroclaw"
    }
    token: "58f4ca17-9c6f-437b-8204-beb47bbee364"
  ) {
    checkout {
      billingAddress {
        firstName
        lastName
        streetAddress1
        city
        postalCode
      }
    }
    errors {
      field
      message
      code
    }
  }
}
```

Successful response:

```json
{
  "data": {
    "checkoutBillingAddressUpdate": {
      "checkout": {
        "billingAddress": {
          "firstName": "John",
          "lastName": "Smith",
          "streetAddress1": "ul. Tęczowa 7",
          "city": "WROCLAW",
          "postalCode": "53-030"
        }
      },
      "errors": []
    }
  }
}
```

### Errors

Let's create an example of address validation errors. The address below is missing a few fields and has the wrong postal code:

```graphql
mutation {
  checkoutBillingAddressUpdate(
    billingAddress: {
      country: PL
      firstName: "John"
      lastName: "Smith"
      postalCode: "Wrong Code"
    }
    token: "58f4ca17-9c6f-437b-8204-beb47bbee364"
  ) {
    errors {
      field
      message
      code
    }
  }
}
```

Response:

```json
{
  "data": {
    "checkoutBillingAddressUpdate": {
      "errors": [
        {
          "field": "city",
          "message": "This field is required.",
          "code": "REQUIRED"
        },
        {
          "field": "postalCode",
          "message": "This value is not valid for the address.",
          "code": "INVALID"
        },
        {
          "field": "streetAddress1",
          "message": "This field is required.",
          "code": "REQUIRED"
        },
        {
          "field": "streetAddress2",
          "message": "This field is required.",
          "code": "REQUIRED"
        }
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

Each field is validated separately, and each issue has a corresponding error code:

- `postalCode` with the wrong format throws the `INVALID` error
- missing fields mentioned in `requiredFields` throw the `REQUIRED` error

## Skipping the address validation

Since version 3.19, Saleor can skip part of address validation. To enable this, set the `skipValidation` flag to `true` in the `AddressInput`.
This disables format validation for all fields except the `country` and `phone`. Saleor will still validate required address items and will try to normalize valid fields.

:::info
Using the `skipValidation` flag may require extra permissions.

- `checkoutCreate` - requires `HANDLE_CHECKOUT` and `AUTHENTICATED_APP` permissions.
- `accountAddressCreate` and `accountUpdate` - require `IMPERSONATE_USER` and `AUTHENTICATED_APP` permissions.
- `accountAddressUpdate` - requires `MANAGE_USERS` and `AUTHENTICATED_APP` permissions.

:::

:::warning
Providing an invalid address may cause Saleor to be unable to complete some external requests.
For example, an incorrect address could result in errors in the tax app response and an inability to create an order.
