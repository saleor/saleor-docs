title: Extensions
---

Saleor has two ways to extend its functionality:

- [Apps](developer/extending/apps/overview.mdx) - technology-agnostic clients that can communicate with Saleor using API and webhooks.
- [Plugins](#plugins) - legacy extensions living in the core Saleor codebase.

Your Saleor Cloud instance comes with an [App Store](#saleor-app-store): a set of off-the-shelf apps you can install from the Dashboard.

## Saleor App Store

:::info

Saleor App Store is exclusive for Saleor Cloud users.

If you are self-hosting, you can [install apps](developer/extending/apps/installing-apps.mdx) manually.

Majority of Saleor Apps are [open source](https://github.com/saleor/apps). Feel free to fork them and host on your own infrastructure.

:::

Saleor App Store is a [Saleor Cloud](/cloud/overview.mdx) feature that provides an instantly installable collection of apps. Each app brings new functionality to Saleor, often by integrating with third-party services.

You can explore available extensions under the "Explore" section in "Extensions" tab in Saleor Dashboard menu.

:::tip

Besides the official apps available in the App Store, make sure to check out the [Community Examples](developer/extending/apps/developing-apps/app-examples.mdx).

### Usage

Saleor App Store consists of two sections:

- Installed Extensions - a list of extensions that are currently installed on your instance
- Explore Extensions - a list of available extensions

Clicking the _Install_ button on any extension card will trigger the installation process during which you will be asked to confirm the required extension permissions. After doing so, the extension will appear in the _Installed Extensions_ section.

If you want to deactivate or delete an extension, open the extension from the installed list, click on the _Manage extensions_ button. You can manage your extension from there.

An extension may require additional configuration (f.e. API key from a service it integrates with). Each extension has its own documentation page which contains the configuration instructions.


## Plugins

Plugins are a legacy way of extending Saleor functionality. They are implemented in the core Saleor codebase. New integrations should be implemented as [apps](developer/extending/apps/overview.mdx).

We plan to replace some plugins with apps and deprecate the rest.

Currently, Saleor maintains the following plugins:

- [Braintree](developer/app-store/plugins/braintree.mdx)
- [Stripe](developer/app-store/plugins/stripe.mdx)
- [OIDC](developer/app-store/plugins/oidc.mdx)
