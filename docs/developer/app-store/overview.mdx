title: Apps and Integrations
---

Saleor has two ways to extend its functionality:

- [Apps](developer/extending/apps/overview.mdx) - technology-agnostic clients that can communicate with Saleor using API and webhooks.
- [Plugins](#plugins) - legacy extensions living in the core Saleor codebase.

Your Saleor Cloud instance comes with an [App Store](#saleor-app-store): a set of off-the-shelf apps you can install from the Dashboard.

## Saleor App Store

:::info

Saleor App Store is exclusive for Saleor Cloud users.

If you are self-hosting, you can [install apps](developer/extending/apps/installing-apps.mdx) manually.

Majority of Saleor Apps are [open source](https://github.com/saleor/apps). Feel free to fork them and host on your own infrastructure.

:::

Saleor App Store is a [Saleor Cloud](/cloud/overview.mdx) feature that provides an instantly installable collection of apps. Each app brings new functionality to Saleor, often by integrating with third-party services.

You can find Saleor App Store under the _Apps_ tab in the Dashboard menu.

Besides the official apps available in the App Store, make sure to check out the [Community Examples](developer/extending/apps/developing-apps/app-examples.mdx).

### Usage

Saleor App Store consists of two sections:

- Installed Apps - a list of apps that are currently installed on your instance
- All Apps - a list of all apps available in the App Store

Clicking the _Install_ button on any app card will trigger the installation process during which you will be asked to confirm the required app permissions. After doing so, the app will appear in the _Installed Apps_ section.

If you want to deactivate or delete an app, click on the _Settings_ button next to the app name in the _Installed Apps_ section. You can manage your app from there.

An app may require additional configuration (f.e. API key from a service it integrates with). Each app has its own documentation page which contains the configuration instructions.


## Plugins

Plugins are a legacy way of extending Saleor functionality. They are implemented in the core Saleor codebase. New integrations should be implemented as [apps](developer/extending/apps/overview.mdx).

We plan to replace some plugins with apps and deprecate the rest.

Currently, Saleor maintains the following plugins:

- [Braintree](developer/app-store/plugins/braintree.mdx)
- [Stripe](developer/app-store/plugins/stripe.mdx)
- [OIDC](developer/app-store/plugins/oidc.mdx)
