This app exports Saleor catalog to [ACP Feed format](https://developers.openai.com/commerce/specs/feed). It allows
compliant platforms like ChatGPT to index and display Saleor products directly within the Chat.

:::note
The app is in beta. We plan to develop it in sync with the ACP, adjusting as the protocol matures and adoption grows.
:::

## Features

- Scans Saleor database on demand
- Creates a JSON file with mapped items

## Assumptions & limitations

- App is frontend-only and all the logic happens within Saleor Dashboard App page.
- App does not auto-update on product changes. Additional scan must be run.
- App does not upload feed to OpenAI or any other platform. Result file must be uploaded manually.

## Permissions required by the app

- `MANAGE_PRODUCTS`

## Pre-requisites

App requires attributes to be created and assigned to product variants.

## Configuration

App generates a single feed per channel. Each time feed is generated, following fields should be provided. We recommend
to provide all of them.
Some of the fields (according to spec) are required. If the attributes mapping is missing, variants will be missing in
the output file. Some attributes are optional,
but we recommend to field them all.

Attributes should exist on variants, not on products.

- Channel: Provide a channel which will be scanned as products source
- Size attribute slug: Attribute slug that stores size attribute. Should be single choice or plain text.
- Brand attribute slug: Attribute slug that stores brand attribute. Should be single choice or plain text.
- Color attribute slug: Attribute slug that stores color attribute. Should be single choice or plain text.
- Material attribute slug: Attribute slug that stores material attribute. Should be single choice or plain text.
- Condition attribute slug: Attribute slug that stores condition attribute. Should be single choice or plain text.
  Should be "new", "used" or "refurbished"
- Return window attribute slug: Attribute slug that stores time in days when product can be returned. Should be numeric
  or string attribute with valid integer value.
- Image fallback URL: When no image added on variant nor product, this image will be used as a fallback
- Seller name: Name of the merchant to display
- Root storefront URL: Address of the storefront
- Privacy Policy URL, Terms of Service URL, Returns policy URL: Links to legal pages
- Storefront template: Storefront URL with placeholders. Available placeholders are `{productId}`, `{variantSku}`,
  `{productSlug}`, `{variantId}`

## Troubleshooting

### Result json is empty (`[]`)

App doesn't map variants which miss required fields. Ensure you properly map attributes and provide valid slugs in the
configuration
