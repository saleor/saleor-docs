## Pre-requisites

- Create an account on [Twillo Segment](https://segment.com/).
- Create a HTTP API [source](https://segment.com/docs/partners/sources/) in the Segment Dashboard UI and note down the Write Key for this source.

## Installation

- Go to the Apps section in your Saleor Dashboard. Pick Twilio Segment and Install.

## Configuration

- Paste [Write Key](https://segment.com/docs/connections/find-writekey/) into the main configuration form in the app and click `Save`.

### Testing

To test if your app is working, create an order and update its address or shipping in the Saleor Dashboard. Then, go to the Segment Dashboard; you should see the `Saleor Order Updated` event in Segment.

## Troubleshooting

- **Events are not showing in Segment Dashboard**
    - Ensure you have set your Write Key in the app configuration screen.
    - Trigger one of the supported events (see [application flow section](/developer/app-store/apps/segment/overview.mdx#application-flow) for more details).

## Development

To run the application locally, follow the [_Running Saleor Apps locally_ article](/developer/extending/apps/developing-apps/running-saleor-apps-locally).

Segment app specific instructions can be found inside app GitHub [repository](https://github.com/saleor/apps/tree/main/apps/segment).
