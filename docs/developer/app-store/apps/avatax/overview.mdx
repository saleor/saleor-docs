_AvaTax_ is a Saleor app that allows delegating tax calculations to [Avalara AvaTax](https://www.avalara.com/us/en/products/calculations.html).It can replace the default ([flat rates](developer/taxes.mdx#flat-rates)) tax calculation method in Saleor. It affects both the checkout and the order creation process.

Avalara AvaTax is a cloud-based solution automating transaction tax calculations and the tax filing process. Avalara
provides real-time tax calculation using tax content from more than 12,000 US taxing jurisdictions and over 200
countries, insuring your transaction tax is calculated based on the most current tax rules.

## Architecture

If you want to explore how the AvaTax App works, you can read the [AvaTax App architecture](./architecture) article.

## Configuration

### Channels

For a channel to appear on the _Available channels_ list, you must first select **"use tax app"** as its tax calculation method. You can do that on the _Tax Configuration_ page (_Configuration_ → _Taxes_).

In the _Taxes_ page, select the channel and change the value of _Select the method of tax calculation_ to "_Use tax app_". Then save it and come back to the AvaTax App.

### Providers

In the _Tax providers_ section, you can manage your tax provider instances. Each tax provider instance is a different configuration. It can be used to have different settings per-channel, e.g. sandbox and production.

Visit [AvaTax](./configuration) page to learn how to set up the App.

## Application logs

App stores logs (for 14 days) for debugging purposes. Logs are not used by Saleor employees, but are useful for staff users to debug transactional operations.

Logs contain following data:
- Saleor Checkout ID / Order ID
- Saleor Channel slug
- Type of object (Checkout or Order) connected to log
- Calculated taxes for Checkout or Order that app sends to Saleor
