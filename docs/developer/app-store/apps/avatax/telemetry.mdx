AvaTax app uses [Open Telemetry](https://opentelemetry.io/) (OTEL) protocol to send signals to your collector of choice.

:::caution

This feature is in the **Feature Preview** stage, which means that it is available for experimentation and
feedback. However, it is still undergoing development and is subject to modifications. If you want to try it contact [our team](mailto:hello@saleor.io).

App automatically instruments several spans for you to provide useful insights into AvaTax app performance.

## `calling AvaTax createOrAdjustTransaction API`

* `avatax.document_type`: one of [AvaTax document type](https://developer.avalara.com/avatax/dev-guide/transactions/document-types/)
* `avatax.enviroment`: either `sandbox` or `production`

## `calling AvaTax voidTransaction API`

This span represents process of voiding transaction information in AvaTax API. It keep track of success and failures responses and in case of failure record exception. 
It will be visible as child of `executing orderCancelled webhook handler`.

Attributes:

* `kind`: `CLIENT`
