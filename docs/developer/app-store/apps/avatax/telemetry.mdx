AvaTax app uses [Open Telemetry](https://opentelemetry.io/) (OTEL) protocol to send signals to your collector of choice.

:::caution

This feature is in the **Feature Preview** stage, which means that it is available for experimentation and
feedback. However, it is still undergoing development and is subject to modifications. If you want to try it contact [our team](mailto:hello@saleor.io).

:::

App automatically instruments several spans for you to provide useful insights into AvaTax app performance.

Attributes on spans follow [OpenTelemetry semantic conventions](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/specs/semconv/general/trace/). 

## `executing checkoutCalculateTaxes webhook handler`

This span represents process of handling [checkoutCalculateTaxes](api-reference/taxes/objects/calculate-taxes.mdx) event. It keep track of success and failures responses send back to Saleor and in case of failure record exception.

Attributes:

* `kind`: `SERVER`
* `code`: `OK` for success and `ERROR` for case of error
* `message`: Internal app message - in case of error: exception reason and in case of success: successful webhook handling confirmation
* `saleor.enviroment_domain`: Your store domain e.g: `your-store.saleor.cloud`

## `executing orderCalculateTaxes webhook handler`

This span represents process of handling [orderCalculateTaxes](api-reference/taxes/objects/calculate-taxes.mdx) event. It keep track of success and failures responses send back to Saleor and in case of failure record exception.

Attributes:

* `kind`: `SERVER`
* `code`: `OK` for success and `ERROR` for case of error
* `message`: Internal app message - in case of error: exception reason and in case of success: successful webhook handling confirmation
* `saleor.enviroment_domain`: Your store domain e.g: `your-store.saleor.cloud`

## `executing orderCancelled webhook handler`

This span represents process of handling [orderCancelled](api-reference/orders/objects/order-cancelled.mdx) event. It keep track of success and failures responses send back to Saleor and in case of failure record exception.

Attributes:

* `kind`: `SERVER`
* `code`: `OK` for success and `ERROR` for case of error
* `message`: Internal app message - in case of error: exception reason and in case of success: successful webhook handling confirmation
* `saleor.enviroment_domain`: Your store domain e.g: `your-store.saleor.cloud`

## `executing orderConfirmed handler`

This span represents process of handling [orderConfirmed](api-reference/orders/objects/order-confirmed.mdx) event. It keep track of success and failures responses send back to Saleor and in case of failure record exception.

Attributes:

* `kind`: `SERVER`
* `code`: `OK` for success and `ERROR` for case of error
* `message`: Internal app message - in case of error: exception reason and in case of success: successful webhook handling confirmation
* `saleor.enviroment_domain`: Your store domain e.g: `your-store.saleor.cloud`

## `calling AvaTax createOrAdjustTransaction API`

This span represents process of sending transaction information to AvaTax API. It keep track of success and failures responses and in case of failure record exception. 
It will be visible as child of `executing checkoutCalculateTaxes webhook handler`, `executing orderCalculateTaxes webhook handler` or `executing orderConfirmed handler` - depending on which handler was called.

Attributes:

* `kind`: `CLIENT`
* `code`: `OK` for success and `ERROR` for case of error
* `message`: Internal app message - in case of error: exception reason and in case of success: successful API call confirmation
* `saleor.enviroment_domain`: Your store domain e.g: `your-store.saleor.cloud`
* `peer.service`: `avatax`
* `avatax.document_type`: one of [AvaTax document type](https://developer.avalara.com/avatax/dev-guide/transactions/document-types/)
* `avatax.enviroment`: either `sandbox` or `production`

## `calling AvaTax voidTransaction API`

This span represents process of voiding transaction information in AvaTax API. It keep track of success and failures responses and in case of failure record exception. 
It will be visible as child of `executing orderCancelled webhook handler`.

Attributes:

* `kind`: `CLIENT`
* `code`: `OK` for success and `ERROR` for case of error
* `message`: Internal app message - in case of error: exception reason and in case of success: successful API call confirmation
* `saleor.enviroment_domain`: Your store domain e.g: `your-store.saleor.cloud`
* `peer.service`: `avatax`
* `avatax.code`: AvaTax voided reason code: `DocVoided`
* `avatax.enviroment`: either `sandbox` or `production`

## `calling AvaTax listEntityUseCodes API`

This span represents process of retreiving entity code information from AvaTax API. It keep track of success and failures responses and in case of failure record exception. 
It will be visible as child of `executing checkoutCalculateTaxes webhook handler` or `executing orderCalculateTaxes webhook handler` if you provide [avataxEntityCode](developer/app-store/apps/avatax/configuration.mdx#entity-type) on Order or Checkout metadata.

Attributes:

* `kind`: `CLIENT`
* `code`: `OK` for success and `ERROR` for case of error
* `message`: Internal app message - in case of error: exception reason and in case of success: successful API call confirmation
* `saleor.enviroment_domain`: Your store domain e.g: `your-store.saleor.cloud`
* `peer.service`: `avatax`
* `avatax.use_code`: code used to filter listEntityUseCodes AvaTax API
