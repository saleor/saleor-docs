You will need SMTP server credentials. Email templates are created using [MJML](https://mjml.io/) language and can be edited in the app dashboard.
Dynamic parts of the email (for example the number of the order) can be added using [Handlebars](https://handlebarsjs.com/).
For more advanced template features you can use [handlebars-helpers](https://github.com/helpers/handlebars-helpers)

## Before you start - server credentials

Using this provider requires access to the SMTP server. Depending on your needs, you may use:

- [Amazon SES](https://aws.amazon.com/ses/)
- [Mailgun](https://www.mailgun.com/)
- [Mailtrap](https://mailtrap.io/)

## Creating configuration

1. Open the SMTP app in Saleor Dashboard
2. Click on `Add configuration`
3. Provide SMTP server credentials for your SMTP server
4. Click on `Save provider`. The application will redirect automatically to the configuration details
5. Enter sender details, which will be displayed as the author of the emails for your customers. Click on `Save provider`
6. In the events section, choose which emails should be sent. You can also modify the template of the emails.
7. Click on `Save provider`

Now the application is configured and emails will be sent.

## Testing

If you don't have access to the SMTP server, you can use an external service for testing, for example:

- [Mailtrap](https://mailtrap.io/)
- [MailSlurp](https://www.mailslurp.com/)

Both services provide a free plan that will allow you to test email delivery.

:::tip

Both services have similar functionality. The following guide will use MailSlurp as an example.

:::

1. Create an account at [MailSlurp](https://www.mailslurp.com/)
2. Create a new inbox - [documentation](https://www.mailslurp.com/guides/creating-inboxes/)
3. Choose `SMTP` as the inbox type
4. Choose `Virtual inbox`. This will create an inbox that captures all emails, so none will be sent to the original addressee
5. Configure the SMTP provider in the application:
   - Fill SMTP server credentials form
   - Use inbox address as sender email

More information can be found in [the official guide](https://help.mailtrap.io/article/109-getting-started-with-mailtrap-email-testing).

### Local development

If you are a developer working on EAM and don't want to use an external service, you can use [MailHog](https://github.com/mailhog/MailHog), which comes pre-configured in this repository.

Requirements:

- Docker is installed
- `docker compose` command is available

To start the service:

1. Open the EAM app folder in terminal
2. Use the command `docker compose up`

Mailhog will start the SMTP server and web interface. Now you can update provider configuration:

- Host: `localhost`
- Port: `1025`
- The rest can be left empty

All emails will be captured by the MailHog service. To inspect emails, open `http://localhost:8025/` in your browser.
