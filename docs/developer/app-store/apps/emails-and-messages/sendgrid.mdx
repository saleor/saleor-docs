# Sendgrid provider

:::info

Using this provider requires a Sendgrid account. You can create one [here](https://signup.sendgrid.com/).

Sendgrid is a cloud-based email delivery and management platform that provides businesses with a solution for sending transactional and marketing emails. It offers a set of tools and APIs that enable developers to integrate email functionality into their applications, websites, or software products.

## Configuration

Before you start using the App, configure your Sendgrid Account:

- Generate [**API key**](https://docs.sendgrid.com/for-developers/sending-email/brite-verify#creating-a-new-api-key)

- Create [**Sender**](https://docs.sendgrid.com/ui/sending-email/senders)

- For every event message you want to send to the customers, create a [**Dynamic template**](https://docs.sendgrid.com/ui/sending-email/how-to-send-an-email-with-dynamic-templates#design-a-dynamic-template)

2. Create [a new inbox in MailSlurp](https://www.mailslurp.com/guides/creating-inboxes/)
3. Use the inbox address to [create a new sender in Sendgrid]https://docs.sendgrid.com/ui/sending-email/senders)
4. Confirm the sender by clicking on the link in the MailSlurp inbox
5. Configure the provider in the Emails and Messages app to use the new sender
