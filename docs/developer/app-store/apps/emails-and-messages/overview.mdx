# Introduction

Emails and messages (EAM) application is responsible for sending emails and messages to the customers. It is connected to the Saleor API via webhooks, which notify the application about the events. The messages are delivered by external providers configured in the application.

## Suported providers

Emails and Messages app currently supports the following providers:

- [Sendgrid](sendgrid) - Create templates in the Sendgrid visual editor and send them to your customers.
- [SMTP](smtp) - Use your own SMTP server to send emails. Email templates are created using MJML and handlebars.

## Supported events

### Account confirmation

A message containing an account activation token after registration. To activate the account, your storefront should perform an API call according to [the documentation](developer/users#registration-with-email-confirmation).

If you don't want to use the email confirmation, you can disable it in the Saleor dashboard:

1. Open the Saleor dashboard
1. Navigate to the Configuration page
1. Click on the Site settings card
1. Update the `User registration` form

The event has been implemented using the `NOTIFY` webhook.

### Account password reset

Message sent after requesting a password change. The payload contains a token that has to be attached to the request to the Saleor API to change the password. To implement a storefront interface for password change, follow [the documentation](developer/users#resetting-the-password).

The event has been implemented using the `NOTIFY` webhook.

### Account password reset for accounts created by the staff

As in the previous event, but for accounts created by Staff users in the Saleor Dashboard.

The event has been implemented using the `NOTIFY` webhook.

### Account email change confirmation

### Sent gift card

The event has been implemented using the `GIFT_CARD_SENT` webhook.

## Configuration

The application can use multiple providers at the same time. This way, you'll be able to:

- create test configurations before using them in production
- use different providers for different events
- use different providers for different channels

### Multichannel

Each provider can be configured to work with specific channels. The configurations by default are used for all channels. It can be changed in the configuration details to:

- use only the specific channels
- use all channels except the specific ones

## Development

To run the application locally, follow the [documentation](../../development).

## Known limitations and issues

- When the application has multiple active configurations and one of them fails, it may result in duplicated email deliveries. [Issue link](https://github.com/saleor/apps/issues/725)
- Emails use the default language of the Saleor instance. Using translations is not supported yet. [Issue link](https://github.com/saleor/apps/issues/726)
- The order refunded event is not supported yet. [Issue link](https://github.com/saleor/apps/issues/728)
