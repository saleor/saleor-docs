## Overview

_Products Feed_ app allows to generation of an XML file with products and their details. The file can be used as a feed source for Google Merchant Center.

## Features

- Generate XML file with products and their details
- Allow to store feed file in S3 bucket
- Generating separate feeds for each channel
- Possibility to map Saleor categories to pre-defined Google categories
- Map Saleor attributes to Google attributes

## Limitations

- The app uses a serverless function to handle feed generation. It means that the app is limited by a serverless function maximum execution time, which might cause a timeout when the product catalogue is big.

## Permissions

The app requires `MANAGE_PRODUCTS` permission to listen to product events.

To save app configuration, staff users must have `MANAGE_PRODUCTS` permission.

## Configuration

### S3 bucket

In case you want to send generated file to S3 bucket, you need to provide the following details:

- `AWS Access Key ID`
- `AWS Secret`
- `AWS S3 Bucket Name`
- `AWS S3 Bucket Region`

You can test the connection to S3 bucket by clicking `Test connection` button.

### Channels

You can generate separate feed for each channel. To do that, you need to provide the following details:

- `Storefront URL`
- `Storefront product URL`

You can use `Handerbars` format to customize product URL. For example, you can use `{{ productSlug }}` to generate a product URL with slug.

You can use variables like this:

```
{{ variant.product.slug }} - product `slug`
{{ variant.id }} - product variant id
```

#### Example:

For this url `https://my-shop.com/p/{{ variant.product.slug}/{{ variant.id }}` will produce `https://my-shop.com/p/t-shirt/Xyp2asZ`

### Item title

You can use `Handerbars` format to customize the product title. For example, you can use `{{variant.product.name}} - {{variant.name}}` to generate product title.

### Categories mapping

You can map Saleor categories to pre-defined Google categories, but this is optional.
Google automatically assign a category to a product, but in some cases, Google allows to override it.
