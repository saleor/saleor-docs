The Adyen App is a payment integration app that allows merchants using the Saleor e-commerce platform to accept online payments from customers using Adyen as their payment processor. In addition to processing payments, the Saleor App Payment Adyen provides merchants with tools for managing refunds and chargebacks.

## Assumptions

- If Adyen doesn't respond to app request for [initialize transaction session](/developer/extending/webhooks/synchronous-events/transaction#initialize-transaction-session) or [process transaction session](/developer/extending/webhooks/synchronous-events/transaction#process-transaction-session) with `pspReference`:
  - App will return `CHARGE_ACTION_REQUIRED` or `AUTHORIZATION_ACTION_REQUIRED` as the transaction result. This is because Saleor doesn't require `pspReference` in app response for these transaction results.
- App might not return `pspReference` for:
  - [Transaction refund webhook](/developer/extending/webhooks/synchronous-events/transaction#transaction-refund) with transaction status of `REFUND_FAILURE`
  - [Transaction charge webhook](/developer/extending/webhooks/synchronous-events/transaction#transaction-charge) with transaction status of `CHARGE_FAILURE`
  - [Transaction cancelation webhook](/developer/extending/webhooks/synchronous-events/transaction#transaction-cancelation) with transaction status of `CANCEL_FAILURE`
  - [Initialize transaction session webhook](/developer/extending/webhooks/synchronous-events/transaction#initialize-transaction-session) with transaction status of:
    - `CHARGE_ACTION_REQUIRED`
    - `AUTHORIZATION_ACTION_REQUIRED`
    - `CHARGE_FAILURE`
    - `AUTHORIZATION_FAILURE`
  - [Process transaction session webhook](/developer/extending/webhooks/synchronous-events/transaction#process-transaction-session) with transaction status of:
    - `CHARGE_ACTION_REQUIRED`
    - `AUTHORIZATION_ACTION_REQUIRED`
    - `CHARGE_FAILURE`
    - `AUTHORIZATION_FAILURE`
