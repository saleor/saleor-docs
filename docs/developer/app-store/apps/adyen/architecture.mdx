## Webhook events

The Adyen App implements the following [Saleor sync webhooks related to transactions](developer/extending/webhooks/synchronous-events/transaction.mdx):

- [`PAYMENT_GATEWAY_INITIALIZE_SESSION`](api-reference/webhooks/enums/webhook-event-type-sync-enum.mdx#webhookeventtypesyncenumpayment_gateway_initialize_session)
- [`TRANSACTION_INITIALIZE_SESSION`](api-reference/webhooks/enums/webhook-event-type-sync-enum.mdx#webhookeventtypesyncenumtransaction_initialize_session)
- [`TRANSACTION_PROCESS_SESSION`](api-reference/webhooks/enums/webhook-event-type-sync-enum.mdx#webhookeventtypesyncenumtransaction_process_session)
- [`TRANSACTION_CHARGE_REQUESTED`](api-reference/webhooks/enums/webhook-event-type-sync-enum.mdx#webhookeventtypesyncenumtransaction_charge_requested)
- [`TRANSACTION_CANCEL_REQUESTED`](api-reference/webhooks/enums/webhook-event-type-sync-enum.mdx#webhookeventtypesyncenumtransaction_cancelation_requested)
- [`TRANSACTION_REFUND_REQUESTED`](api-reference/webhooks/enums/webhook-event-type-sync-enum.mdx#webhookeventtypesyncenumtransaction_refund_requested)

Furthermore, it's also prepared to handle [async Adyen webhooks](https://docs.adyen.com/development-resources/webhooks.mdx).

The Adyen App follows the flow described in detail in the [Saleor Payment App documentation](developer/payments/overview.mdx).

## Limitations

This section contains known limitations of this App.

### Maximum timeout for Adyen calls is 15 seconds

Saleor synchronous webhooks have a maximum response time limit of 20 seconds. The app restricts the Adyen response time to 15 seconds to allow graceful error handling.
If Adyen surpasses this limit, the App will return a FAILURE status with an appropriate error message (Timeout Error).

### Maximum timeout for Saleor API calls is 5 seconds

The app restricts Saleor API response time to 5 seconds for [`TransactionInitializeSession`](developer/extending/webhooks/synchronous-events/transaction.mdx#initialize-transaction-session) and [`TransactionProcessSession`](developer/extending/webhooks/synchronous-events/transaction.mdx#process-transaction-session) subscriptions. If Saleor API surpasses this limit, the App will gracefully continue processing.

If such timeout happens, the created [`TransactionItem`](api-reference/payments/objects/transaction-item.mdx) will not have the metadata from Adyen on `additionalDetails` object, which includes payment method type, credit card brand, etc.

### Refund with line items vs refund with manual amount

:::note
In Saleor Dashboard you can choose between two types of refunds that use different Saleor APIs:
- **"Refund with line items"** - creates [OrderGrantedRefund](/api-reference/orders/objects/order-granted-refund.mdx) and sends a refund to Adyen App using [`transactionRequestRefundForGrantedRefund`](/api-reference/payments/mutations/transaction-request-refund-for-granted-refund.mdx)
- **"Refund with manual amount"** - sends refund request to Adyen App using [`transactionRequestAction`](api-reference/payments/mutations/transaction-request-action.mdx)
:::

There are differences in how refunds are handled depending on whether a [`OrderGrantedRefund`](/api-reference/orders/objects/order-granted-refund.mdx) was created in Saleor and a refund via [`transactionRequestRefundForGrantedRefund`](api-reference/payments/mutations/transaction-request-refund-for-granted-refund.mdx) mutation was requested, or a "manual refund" sent via [`transactionRequestAction`](/api-reference/payments/mutations/transaction-request-action.mdx) mutation was requested. The differences are in how [`lineItems`](https://docs.adyen.com/api-explorer/Checkout/71/post/payments/_paymentPspReference_/refunds#request-lineItems) are reported to Adyen

#### Refund with manual amount

This refund is initiated using the [`transactionRequestAction`](/api-reference/payments/mutations/transaction-request-action.mdx) mutation.

When a manual refund is requested, the app will send `lineItems` to Adyen if the `amount` is equal to or greater than the Order's total gross amount.
In other cases' app will not send `lineItems` to Adyen.

#### Refund with line items

This refund is initiated using the [`transactionRequestRefundForGrantedRefund`](/api-reference/payments/mutations/transaction-request-refund-for-granted-refund.mdx) mutation.

When refund for granted refund is requested, app will map `grantedRefund.lines.orderLines` to `lineItems` reported to Adyen. Additionally, if `grantedRefund.shippingCostIncluded` is set to true, the app will include a shipping line in the `lineItems` sent to Adyen.

## TransactionItem metadata

App sets metadata on each `TransactionItem` it creates in Saleor. Metadata is set when app receives asynchronous confirmation from Adyen via webhook.

### Configuring fields included in metadata

Adyen app sets fields on metadata from `NotificationItem.additionalData` object it receives from Adyen. To configure which fields are included by Adyen go to `Developres > Additional data` and select your preferred fields.

:::caution
Remember to always include the following fields for proper notification handling:
- `Authorization amount`
- `Authorisation amount (dynamic zero authorisation)`
- `Recurring details`
- `Merchant reference`
:::

For example, if you want to have data about used payment method, and it's variant choose:
- `Subvariant`
- `Variant`
- `Co-brand`
- `Expiry date`
- `Card summary`


After choosing these settings, you will have the following fields set on your `TransactionItem` metadata:

```json
{
  "cardSummary": "1111",
  "expiryDate": "8/2018",
  "paymentMethodVariant": "visadebit",
  "paymentMethod": "visa",
  "coBrandedWith": "visa",
  "authorisedAmountCurrency": "EUR",
  "authorisedAmountValue": "1000",
  "recurring.shopperReference": "testshopper",
  "recurring.recurringDetailReference": "1111111111111111",
  "merchantReference": "ref_1234"
}
```

### Subscribing to metadata changes

The best way to check metadata updates on TransactionItem is to subscribe to [`TRANSACTION_ITEM_METADATA_UPDATED`](/api-reference/webhooks/enums/webhook-event-type-async-enum.mdx#webhookeventtypeasyncenumtransaction_item_metadata_updated) async webhook event. This way you can be sure that metadata is up-to-date in your external system (e.g. if you use metadata to store which payment method was used for tax purposes).

If you include `metafields` or `metadata` from `TransactionItem` in any other subscription, it might not be set at all, or be out-of-date.

:::note
For example, if you use `ORDER_CREATED` webhook to check `TransactionItem.metadata` then if your customer has completed checkout very quickly, metadata might not yet be set on `TransactionItem`. This means it won't be included in a notification from Saleor.
:::

#### Example

Here's an example subscription query that listens to metadata changes

```graphql
subscription {
  event {
    ... on TransactionItemMetadataUpdated {
      __typename
      issuingPrincipal {
        ... on App {
          identifier
        }
      }
      transaction {
        id
        pspReference
        order {
          id
        }
        metafields
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## Capture delay

All payment methods that have "separate capture" feature available (to check availability, refer to [Adyen docs](https://docs.adyen.com/payment-methods/) and look for methods with "Separate captures" listed in the features) are impacted by capture delay setting in merchant account.

Capture is a transfer of previously locked funds to the merchant. In Adyen, you can either:
- capture funds immediately after authorization: `captureDelay: immediate`
- delay it for a certain period of time: `captureDelay: x hours`
- disable automatic capture and always do it manually: `captureDelay: manual`

:::tip
Remember that capture can expire after a certain period of time if it is not extended. This depends on used payment method. For example, most credit cards authorizations expire after 28 days.

To see expiration time for specific payment methods, [see this documentation page in Adyen docs](https://docs.adyen.com/online-payments/adjust-authorisation/#validity)

Expired payments can be re-authorized, although this comes with some risk. [See Adyen docs for more information](https://docs.adyen.com/account/manage-payments/#reauthorize-a-payment)
:::

The delay can be set in the Adyen dashboard in the merchant account settings.

### TransactionFlowStrategy

Saleor channel settings include a [`paymentSettings.defaultTransactionFlowStrategy`](/api-reference/payments/inputs/payment-settings-input.mdx) setting. Here's how it impacts payments done via Adyen App:

- **`TransactionFlowStrategyEnum.CHARGE`** - Behavior of merchant account capture delay settings will be used, no change is made by app:
  - If capture delay is set to **immediate**, capture will be created, there won't be authorization event in Transaction history
  - If capture delay is set to **x hours**, first authorization will be made, then a Transaction will be automatically captured after x hours
  - If capture delay is set to **manual**, authorization will be done instead of a charge, which must be captured either in Saleor Dashboard or Adyen Dashboard
- **`TransactionFlowStrategyEnum.AUTHORIZE`** - App will use [`manualCapture: true`](https://docs.adyen.com/online-payments/capture/?tab=1#enable-manual-capture) field when making payments, it behaves the same way as if `captureDelay: manual` was set in Adyen merchant account settings
  - If capture delay is set to **immediate**, behavior is changed, this setting will be ignored and authorization will be done instead
  - If capture delay is set to **x hours**, behavior is changed, this setting will be ignored and authorization will be done instead
  - If capture delay is set to **manual**, there is no change in behavior, authorization will be created

:::note
If payment method doesn't support "separate capture" feature, it will always be charged, no matter any setting in Adyen or Saleor.
