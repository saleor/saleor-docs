Below is the list of changes introduced in Adyen App releases

## v.1.4.0

In this release, a functional change was introduced in order to improve handling of `ORDER_CLOSED` notifications from Adyen for Transactions that had failed.

### Before this release

Previously app didn't handle properly `ORDER_CLOSED` notifications from Adyen with Transactions that had already been rejected (e.g. due to fraud).
This resulted in a `chargedAmount` being negative for TransactionItem, which in turn made `totalBalance` on Order and Checkout in Saleor negative.
This prevented users from completing checkouts even after successful payment.

### After this release

Now when Adyen app will handle events related to this case we will:

- For user order cancellations (`orderCancel` action on `paymentGatewayInitializeSession`): before reporting `REFUND_REQUEST` or `CANCEL_REQUEST` event to Saleor, check if Transaction was already rejected, if so then report `INFO` event instead
- For `ORDER_CLOSED` Adyen notification item: before reporting `REFUND_REQUEST` or `CANCEL_REQUEST` event to Saleor, check if Transaction was already rejected, if so then report `INFO` event instead
- For `AUTHORIZATION` with `success: false` Adyen notification item: before reporting `CHARGE_FAILURE` or `AUTHORIZATION_FAILURE` event to Saleor, check if Transaction was already refunded / cancelled, if so then also report `REFUND_FAILURE` or `CANCEL_FAILURE` to revert that previous refund (you can't have both refund and failed payment at the same time).

## v.1.2.2

In this release, a function change was introduced to consume an improved Transactions API in Saleor

### Before this release

If Adyen webhook hasn't received transaction amount, the app fetched transaction history to find it, so it can be returned to Saleor as API contract demands it.

### In this release:

Saleor core implemented change in [3.20.32](https://github.com/saleor/saleor/releases/tag/3.20.32) that make amount optional.
App will now return null as amount if there is none present in Adyen webhook, and it's allowed for [TransactionEvent.type](https://docs.saleor.io/api-reference/payments/enums/transaction-event-type-enum) that will be reported by app to Saleor:

- `CANCEL_FAILURE`
- `CHARGE_FAILURE`
- `AUTHORIZATION_FAILURE`
- `REFUND_FAILURE`
- `REFUND_REVERSE`
- `CHARGE_BACK`
- `INFO`

## v1.1.0

In this release we introduced a *client logs*. Now, some of the operations that are performed by the app (webhooks) will be stored and available to access via the Dashboard.

In the future, more events will be stored.


## v0.24.0 (September 2024)

This release changes when Transaction metadata will be set, based on Adyen response.

### Before this release:

Transaction metadata was updated in `transaction-initialize-session`, `transaction-process-session` webhooks and Adyen webhook handler.

In first two webhooks (sync) metadata was set eagerly, but not complete. It was possible that race condition occurred, causing incomplete metadata overwriting the complete one.
In the final Adyen webhook, metadata was delayed, but was complete.

### In this release:

Metadata will not be updated in `transaction-initialize-session` and `transaction-process-session` webhooks. Adyen webhook behavior will stay the same.

Metadata will be set only once, and it will be set lazy. Metadata will be complete.

### Migration guide

Prior to this release, you may have been listening to `ORDER_UPDATED`, `ORDER_CREATED`, `CHECKOUT_FULLY_PAID` events to access the Transaction's metadata. After this change the `TransactionItem` object will not have any `metadata` until it is updated by Adyen webhook

To ensure you listen to proper events, subscribe to `TRANSACTION_ITEM_METADATA_UPDATED`. This webhook will execute exactly when metadata is set by Adyen.
