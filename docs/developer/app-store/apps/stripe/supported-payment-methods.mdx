title: Stripe App Supported Payment methods
---

Saleor team ensures Stripe App works properly with selected payment methods.
App doesn’t support every method available in Stripe. Saleor team keeps adding them as soon as possible.

The current list of payment methods is:

- [Apple Pay](https://docs.stripe.com/apple-pay)
- [Card](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/cards)
- [Klarna](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/klarna)
- [PayPal](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/paypal)
- [Google Pay](https://docs.stripe.com/google-pay)

Ensure your Stripe Dashboard available methods match the list above.

:::warning

If you enable more methods, Stripe UI will show unsupported methods for customer.
Trying to pay with it will cause App to return an error.
