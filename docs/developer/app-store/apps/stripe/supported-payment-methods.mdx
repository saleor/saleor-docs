title: Stripe App Supported Payment methods
---

Saleor team ensures Stripe App works properly with selected payment methods.
App doesnâ€™t support every method available in Stripe. Saleor team keeps adding them as soon as possible.

The current list of payment methods is:

- [Apple Pay](https://docs.stripe.com/apple-pay)
- [Card](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/cards)
- [Klarna](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/klarna)
- [PayPal](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/paypal)
- [Google Pay](https://docs.stripe.com/google-pay)

Ensure your Stripe Dashboard available methods match the list above.

Warning: if you enable more methods, Stripe UI will show unsupported methods for customer.
Trying to pay with it will cause App to return an error.
