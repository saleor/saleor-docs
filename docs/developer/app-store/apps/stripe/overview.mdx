## Features

The Stripe app offers end-to-end payment flow integration using Transactions API on the Saleor side and Payment Intents API on the Stripe side.

The app:

- Enables seamless configuration through the Saleor Dashboard UI
- Automatically creates Stripe webhooks when a configuration is created (and removes them when a configuration is deleted)
- Allows you to create multiple configurations (such as production/testing or per-channel environments) and map them to specific Saleor channels
- Supports [delayed capture](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/place-a-hold-on-a-payment-method) (authorization flow in Saleor) and instant charge flow
- Enables capturing payments directly from the Saleor Dashboard
- Supports canceling authorizations from the Saleor Dashboard
- Supports canceling Payment Intents from the Stripe Dashboard
- Support refunds
- Provides specific error messages to the Storefront for easier integration

## Limitations

Before installing this app, please review these limitations to ensure they don't conflict with your requirements.
If you need additional features, please contact us or refer to our contribution guide.

- Stripe Checkout is not currently supported
- The app currently supports a limited set of payment methods. We regularly add new payment methods after thorough testing and validation.
- The app does not allow modification of existing configurations; you need to create a new configuration and delete the old one if changes are required.
- One authorized amount can only be captured once (either fully or partially). Multiple captures are not supported.
