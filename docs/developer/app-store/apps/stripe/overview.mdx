Saleor Stripe App is a payment gateway integration that allows customers to pay for their checkouts/orders with Stripe.

Stripe is a leading payments platform offering multiple solutions for millions of companies.

:::warning
App is in Preview Mode, which means it may change significantly. Saleor team will not introduce a breaking change, but it may occur that new app version will be released in short time period and the Preview version will not be supported.

## Features

The Stripe app offers end-to-end payment flow integration using Transactions API on the Saleor side and Payment Intents API on the Stripe side.

The app:

- Allows seamless configuration using Saleor Dashboard UI
- Creates Stripe webhook automatically when configuration is created (and removes webhook when configuration is deleted)
- Allows to create multiple configurations (like production/testing or per-channel environments) and map them to specific Saleor channels
- Supports manual capture (authorization flow) and instant charge flow
- Supports capturing money from Saleor Dashboard
- Supports cancelling authorization from Saleor Dashboard
- Supports cancelling Payment Intents from Stripe Dashboard
- Provides specific errors to the Storefront for easier integration

## Limitations

Before you move on, you need to consider if the existing limitations are not blocking to your use case. Please contact us if you have specific feature you’d like to see or check our contribution guide.

- Stripe Checkout is not supported
- App only supports specific payment methods. We constantly add more, after we ensure they work properly.
- App doesn’t allow to modify existing configuration - you need to create new one and delete the old one.
- One authorized amount can be only captured once (fully or partially). Multiple captures are not supported.
