Majority of application logic happens during webhooks execution:
- Transaction webhooks from Saleor
- Events from Stripe

This page cover each webhook behavior, data it expects and returns and what can it return.

# Saleor Webhooks

App supports following synchronous webhooks. All of these webhooks are executed as a result of explicit mutations called by storefront (to manage payments) or by Dashboard (to capture/cancel/refund payments).

Check Transactions documentation to learn more.

## PaymentGatewayInitializeSession

This webhook checks if App is properly configured and return in the response (to the storefront) Stripe Publishable Key, needed to render the [Stripe Elements UI](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/elements).

It will return following `data` shape

```json
{
  "stripePublishableKey": "pk_live_XYZ"
}
```

## TransactionInitializeSession

This webhook takes data from Storefront and creates a Payment Intent in Stripe.

It requires following `data` shape:

```json
{
  "paymentIntent": {
    "paymentMethod": "card"
  }
}
```

Warning: Data shape will be different depending on selected payment method. Payment Method from Stripe SDK must be provided. When adding more supported payment methods, app may require more fields specific to that payment method.

Warning: Data is strictly validated. It will return errors when:

- Shape is invalid
- Payment method is not supported

Webhook will result with following responses

For successful operation it will set either `CHARGE_ACTION_REQUIRED` or `AUTHORIZATION_ACTION_REQUIRED` and return data:

```json
{
"paymentIntent": {
  "stripeClientSecret": "..."
}
}
```

For failed operation it will set either `CHARGED_FAILURE` or `AUTHORIZATION_FAILURE` in Saleor and return data:

```json
{
  "paymentIntent": {
    "errors": [
      {
        "code": "error code",
        "message": "human readable message"
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

Possible codes are:
- `StripeCardError`
- `StripeApiError`

## TransactionProcessSession

TransactionProcessSession is supposed to be executed once Stripe payment is completed on the storefront. This webhook will fetch Payment Intent from Stripe
and update Saleor transaction with the last state resolved from Payment Intent status.

This webhook doesn't require any data in input.

It can set the following statuses on Saleor transaction (based on Stripe PaymentIntent status) in case of successful processing:

- `CHARGE_SUCCESS`
- `AUTHORIZATION_SUCCESS`
- `CHARGE_ACTION_REQUIRED`
- `AUTHORIZATION_ACTION_REQUIRED`
- `CHARGE_REQUEST`
- `AUTHORIZATION_REQUEST`
- `CHARGE_FAILURE`
- `AUTHORIZATION_FAILURE`

In some cases it can fail to process and return the following data to Storefront

```json
{
"paymentIntent": {
  "errors": [{
    "code": "error code",
    "message": "human readable message"
  }]
  }
}
```

If error occurs, it will set `CHARGE_FAILURE` or `AUTHORIZATION_FAILURE` on Saleor transaction.

Possible codes are:
- `StripeCardError`
- `StripeApiError`


## TransactionChargeRequested

This webhook is executed when staff user wants to capture the payment that was authorized.

todo Krzysiek

## TransactionCancelationRequested

This webhook is executed when staff user wants to cancel the payment that was authorized.

todo Krzysiek

## TransactionRefundRequested

This webhook is executed when staff user wants to refund the payment that was charged.

todo Krzysiek


# Stripe Webhook

When app is being configured, it creates a webhook in Stripe. Webhook is registered for the following events in Stripe:

- `payment_intent.amount_capturable_updated`
- `payment_intent.payment_failed`
- `payment_intent.processing`
- `payment_intent.requires_action`
- `payment_intent.succeeded`
- `payment_intent.canceled`
- `charge.refund.updated`

App will process these events and update Saleor transaction with the last state resolved from Payment Intent status.

Usually the status resolved from this webhook will be the same as the one from ProcessSession webhook. The main difference is that:
- Stripe will send webhook even if Storefront fails to run processSession (e.g. customer closes the browser), so the state will eventually be resolved properly
- Some asynchronous payment methods can take hours of days to return proper status - in such case final state will be resolved in the background, after customer leaves the page.

The webhook will return:
- Status 200 to Stripe when successfully processed
- Status 500 if something broke. In such case, Stripe will try to retry the webhook.

Webhook will report Transaction Event to Saleor via graphQL mutation.
