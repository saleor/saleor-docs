App configuration is based on two entities:

- Individual configurations of Stripe connection
- Mapping between Saleor channel and Stripe configuration

There can be multiple individual configurations. Added configuration is not used, until it’s mapped to the channel.

Saleor channel can be mapped to only one configuration. Once it happens, configuration will be resolved from the channel and used to communicate with Stripe.

To configure the App, open Dashboard → Extensions page and select your installed Stripe App.

Note: To configure the app, logged user must have HANDLE_PAYMENTS and MANAGE_APPS permissions

## Adding Stripe Configuration

New installed app will have an empty configurations list and a button that navigates to the new configuration screen.

Once you get there, you will have to fill the following:

- Configuration name: A friendly label for a staff user to distinct specific configurations, for example “Staging” and “Prod”
- Stripe Publishable Key: A public key Stripe provides in the Dashboard that will be used by Stripe SDK
- Stripe Restricted Key: A fine-grained token that must be generated in Stripe Dashboard with permissions:
    - Payment Intents: Write
    - All Webhook: Write
    - Charges: Write

App will try to validate tokens if possible, it can’t promise it can check if every permission is correct.

After the form is saved, app will create a Stripe Webhook in the background, pointing to the App.

You can check Stripe Dashboard’s webhooks - you should see webhook created.

Warning: App will manage it’s webhooks. Do not disable or remove webhooks on Stripe side when the app is supposed to work - it will fail.

Warning: App will not prune it’s webhooks when uninstalled or disabled. If you want to remove the app, delete configurations first, or remove webhooks in Stripe manually

## Mapping configuration to channel

One configuration is added, you will be able to assign it to the channel. Once it happens, app should be operations

Ensure channel has “Use Transaction flow when marking order as paid” enabled in channel settings
