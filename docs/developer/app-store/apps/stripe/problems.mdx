title: Stripe App Dashboard Problems

The Stripe App uses
the [App Problems API](/developer/extending/apps/developing-apps/apps-patterns/reporting-problems.mdx) to report
operational issues directly to the Saleor Dashboard. When the app detects a configuration or integration problem, it
creates a problem entry visible to store administrators — no log inspection or external monitoring needed.

This feature requires Saleor 3.22.36, for older versions this feature is disabled

## How it works

The app monitors all webhook interactions — both from Saleor (charge, cancel, refund, initialize, process) and from
Stripe — and reports problems when it encounters actionable errors.

In certain cases, app clears problems automatically (e.g. a problem related to specific config is dismissed once such
config is removed). In other cases staff user can dismiss them manually.
