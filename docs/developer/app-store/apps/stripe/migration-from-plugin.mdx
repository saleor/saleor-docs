title: Stripe App - migration from plugin
---

You should consider migrating from the [Stripe Plugin](../../plugins/stripe) to the App. This document will help you with that.

## Why migrate?

Plugins API in Saleor are deprecated, and we are proceeding to remove plugins in favor of Apps. Existing plugins are not maintained.
Apps are more powerful, and they are the future of Saleor extensions.


## Differences between plugin and the App

First, let's start with the main differences.

## How to migrate

### Fetching configuration

The plugin uses the `availePaymentGateways` query to fetch the configuration of the payment gateway. The App uses the `paymentGatewayInitialize` mutation to fetch the configuration.

### Payment mutations

The Plugin uses `checkoutPaymentCreate` mutation to create a payment. The App uses `transactionInitializeSession` and `transactionProcessSession` mutations to create a payment.

See the [integration docs](./storefront-integration) for more details.

### Running `checkoutComplete`

The `checkoutComplete` mutation should be now run at the end of the process, when transactions are reported.

The `paymentData` input should not be used anymore, to transfer data to the App, use `data` fields on the transaction webhooks.

`checkoutConfirm` response fields: `confirmationNeeded` and `confirmationData` should be ignored now.




## Mimic charging after the Order is confirmed

Plugin, when set to automatic capture, will first authorize the funds. After Order is confirmed, will capture (charge) the funds.

App, if set Transaction Flow is set to CHARGE, will charge the funds immediately, when Payments are created.

To mimic the plugin flow, you can:
1. Set Transaction Flow to AUTHORIZATION.
2. Perform the payment flow, funds will be authorized only.
3. Proceed to process the order.
4. Create app that listens to the order confirmation event.
5. Execute `transactionRequestAction(actionType:CHARGE)` mutation from the custom app.
6. Stripe App will receive request to charge the funds.
