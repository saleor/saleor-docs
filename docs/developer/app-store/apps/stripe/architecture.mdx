## Assumptions

App uses assumptions below to make decisions about it's behavior. Changing them will usually mean breaking change, so it's not likely they will change in the future.

### Supporting Authorization flow

App supports both Authorization and Charge flow that can be set in Saleor channel settings. However, not every payment method supports Authorization.

Some methods, support both Authorization and Charge, some - only Charge.

App will proceed following flows (simplified)

Charge Flow

CHARGE_REQUEST → CHARGE_SUCCESS

Authorization Flow + method supports Authorization

AUTHORIZATION_REQUEST → AUTHORIZATION_SUCCESS → CHARGE_REQUEST → CHARGE_SUCCESS

Authorization Flow + method does not support Authorization

AUTHORIZATION_REQUEST → CHARGE_SUCCESS

To wrap up, app can make a decision to make a shortcut from AUTHORIZATION to CHARGE if method doesn’t allow to authorize first.

To make this work, app requires payment method to be provided in `data` of TransactionInitializeSession - see storefront integration

### Stripe event deduplication

Stripe doesn’t guarantee their webhooks will be delivered once and recommend to deduplicate events.

App itself doesn’t de-duplicate - Saleor does. In case of duplicated event, app will resolve the same result (PSP Reference, amount, type) and report it to Saleor again. Saleor will reject this event with an ALREADY_REPORTED error, which app gracefully handles.

### Stripe metadata

At this point app is not setting anything on Stripe’s Payment Intent metadata.

In the future app may store there additional fields, but will not rely on these fields and do not guarantee these fields will be written.

It is fine to use metadata for additional, user-targeted information, but do not build automated logic based on it’s existence.

## Data persistence

App uses its internal database to store the following data:

- App configuration:
    - Stripe publishable key
    - Stripe restricted key (encrypted)
    - Configuration name
    - Internal configuration ID
    - Stripe webhook ID
    - Stripe webhook secret (encrypted)
    - Mapping between channel ID and configuration ID
- Transactions recordings (history of processed transaction):
    - Transaction ID from Saleor
    - Payment Intent ID from Stripe
    - Transaction Flow that Saleor delivers with events
    - Transaction Flow that App computes to use
    - Selected payment method


## Supported flows

This chapter lists flows possible to execute, including Storefront, Saleor, App and Stripe.

Note: Flows that assume operation in Saleor Dashboard can be also executed with graphQL

Note: For brevity, diagrams highlight most important parts of the flow and do not duplicate operations that are not relevant to the flow.
To fully understand the flow, please study all diagrams.

### Render payment UI

```mermaid


sequenceDiagram
    actor Storefront
    actor Saleor
    actor Stripe App
    actor Stripe API

    autonumber
    Stripe API->>Stripe App: Configure app with secret and public keys
    note over Stripe App: App must be configured first

    Storefront->>Saleor: mutation paymentGatewayInitialize
    Saleor->>Stripe App: Webhook: PAYMENT_GATEWAY_INITIALIZE_SESSION
    Stripe App ->> Saleor: Respond with Stripe Publishable Key in "data" field
    Saleor ->> Storefront: Respond with Stripe Publishable Key in "data" field
    Storefront-->>Storefront: Render Stripe UI
```


### Payment with CHARGE flow

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    actor Storefront
    actor Saleor
    actor Stripe App
    actor Stripe API



    Storefront->>Saleor: mutation transactionInitializeSession
    Saleor->>Stripe App: Webhook: TRANSACTION_INITIALIZE_SESSION
    Stripe App ->> Stripe API: Create Payment Intent
    alt Stripe API fails
        Stripe API->>Stripe App: Fail to create intent
        Stripe App ->> Saleor: Respond with CHARGE_FAILURE
        Saleor ->> Storefront: Return failed mutation
        Storefront ->> Storefront: Render failure and prompt to try again
    else Stripe succeesfully creates Intent
        Stripe API->>Stripe App: Success: Provide Payment Intent ID and client secret
        Stripe App ->> Saleor: Respond with CHARGE_ACTION_REQUIRED
        Saleor ->> Storefront: Return client secret in "data"
        Storefront ->> Storefront: Render render UI with payment methods selection
        Storefront ->> Storefront: Customer process full payment on the frontend <br/> Customer sees payment result from Stripe

        par processSession
            Storefront ->> Saleor: mutation transactionProcessSession
            Saleor->>Stripe App: Webhook: TRANSACTION_PROCESS_SESSION
            Stripe App->> Stripe API: Retrieve Payment Intent status
            Stripe API->> Stripe App: Respond with status
            Stripe App->> Saleor: Set event depending on Stripe status
            Saleor ->> Storefront: Return current state of transaction
        and Stripe event
            Stripe API->>Stripe App: Inform about Payment Intent status change
            Stripe App->> Saleor: Set event depending on Stripe status
        end
        Storefront->>Storefront: Can complete the checkout

    end
```

### Payment with AUTHORIZATION flow


### Payment with AUTHORIZATION flow for payment method that does not support authorization

```mermaid


sequenceDiagram
    actor Storefront
    actor Saleor
    actor Stripe App
    actor Stripe API


    Saleor->>Saleor: Channel setting is set to be AUTHORIZATION flow instead CHARGE
    Storefront->>Saleor: mutation transactionInitializeSession<br/> (attached method doesn't support AUTHORIZATION)
    Saleor->>Stripe App: Webhook: TRANSACTION_INITIALIZE_SESSION

    Stripe App ->> Stripe API: Create Payment Intent<br/>Use manual_capture: false
    note over Stripe App: App converts flow to supported one

    Stripe API ->> Stripe App: Respond successfully
    Stripe App ->> Saleor: Respond with CHARGE_SUCCESS
    Saleor ->> Storefront: Return successful mutation
    Storefront ->> Storefront: Render UI


```



### Capturing money from Saleor Dashboard


### Cancelling authorization from Saleor Dashboard

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    %% actor Storefront
    actor Staff User
    actor Saleor
    actor Stripe App
    actor Stripe API

    Staff User->>Saleor: Cancel authorized transaction
    Saleor ->> Stripe App: Webhook TRANSACTION_CANCEL_REQUESTED
    Stripe App ->> Stripe API: Cancel Pament Intent
    Stripe API ->> Stripe App: Result with success of failure
    Stripe App ->> Saleor: Set CANCEL_SUCCESS or CANCEL_FAILURE
    Stripe API ->> Stripe App: Webhook "payment_intent.canceled"
    Stripe App ->> Saleor: Set CANCEL_SUCCESS
```
