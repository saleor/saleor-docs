title: Stripe App Errors

There may be a number of reasons why an error occurs during the payment process.
- Expected errors: e.g., customer provided wrong card details
- App configurations errors: like provided keys are incorrect
- Stripe errors: Stripe API can be down or return unexpected errors
- Integration errors: storefront doesn't provide proper data to mutations
- Saleor errors: Saleor may bo down or return unexpected errors

App is doing its best to detect each class of errors to give the best possible message to the integrator/staff.

There are two types of messages the app is setting at the moment:
1. TransactionEvent.message field - especially when the app is setting "FAILURE"-like events, it can return also a message why it happened
2. `data` errors - errors especially valuable for storefront to debug (reading a message in the network response) or handle errors (reading and translating error codes)

## `data` errors

Errors that come from `data` will *always* have the following structure:

```json5
{
errors: [ // It will be array of errors, in case of multiple errors were caught
      {
        code: "StripeApiError", // This code can be used to react on the cause
        message: "There is a problem with the request to Stripe API" // This message CAN change and should be used for debugging
      }
  ]
}

```

Due to a fact that both `TransactionEvent.message` and `data` are public fields available on the storefront, app will not return details due to security reasons.
However, when testing the integration (using Stripe TEST environment / sandboxes) - app will return error causes attached to the transaction messages and errors attached to `data`.
