NP Atobarai (NP後払い) is a Japanese payment gateway that supports payments on pick-up points.

## Features

- App integrates with [NP Atobarai](https://np-atobarai.jp/) payment gateway.
- App provides `PAYMENT_GATEWAY_INITIALIZE_SESSION` mutation to validate required data: shipping and billing addresses, phone number, currency, and email.
- App supports refunds.


## Limitations and assumptions

Before installing this app, please review these limitations to ensure they don't conflict with your requirements.

- App works only for channels with `JPY` currency.
- App creates transactions within NP Atobarai during the fulfillment process, exactly when tracking number is updated. That means in case of invalid data, direct feedback on the storefront is not possible.
- App works only on `CHARGE` flows. Saleor has limitation to allow fulfillments only when the order is fully charged.
- When a customer does not pick up the delivery, the app will **not** report this to Saleor. Order will remain in the `FULFILLED` and `PAID` state. However, this should be safe, because NP Atobarai should not allow user to pick up the good without paying.
- The App creates only one transaction in NP Atobarai and expects only one to exist for a single transaction in Saleor. If NP Atobarai returns multiple transactions, the app will report `CHARGE_FAILURE`
- The App uses Saleor `transaction.token` as a identifier set in NP Atobarai, due to ID characters limit.
- Tracking number set on Saleor fulfillment must have at most 20 characters.
- Split payments are not supported. App work **only** if a single Atobarai transaction is created to the checkout/order.
