title: NP Atobarai App - how we process your data
---

Data processing is a critical aspect of any application that operates on monetary transactions.
In this document, we outline how the NP Atobarai App processes your data, ensuring compliance with data protection regulations and maintaining the highest standards of security.


## Data persistence

App uses its internal database to store the following data:

- App configuration:
    - NP Atobarai Merchant Code
    - NP Atobarai SP Code (encrypted)
    - NP Atobarai Terminal ID
    - Configuration name
    - Internal configuration ID
    - Mapping between channel ID and configuration ID
- Transactions recordings (history of processed transaction):
    - Saleor fulfillment tracking number
    - Saleor fulfillment metadata (for dynamic carrier configuration)
    - NP Atobarai Transaction ID
    
## Data processing

NP Atobarai App is not processing payment details.

## PCI DSS compliance

This plugin is exempted from PCI DSS requirements due to not allowing users to input any credit card number.

## Data field

Storefront is capable of writing sensitive information to `data` field when making a transaction request.
App is not requesting such data but can't force the storefront to not write it.
App guarantees that only requested fields are being processed and other fields are ignored.

See [webhooks documentation](./webhooks.mdx) for more details about data shape and fields.
