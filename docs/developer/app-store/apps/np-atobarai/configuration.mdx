title: NP Atobarai App Configuration
---

App configuration is based on two entities:

- Individual configurations of NP Atobarai connection
- Mapping between Saleor channel and NP Atobarai configuration

There can be multiple individual configurations. Added configuration is not used until it’s mapped to the channel.

Saleor channel can be mapped to only one configuration. Once it happens, configuration will be resolved from the channel and used to communicate with NP Atobarai.

To configure the App, open the `Dashboard → Extensions` page and select your installed NP Atobarai App.

## Adding NP Atobarai Configuration

The new installed app will have an empty configurations list and a button that navigates to the new configuration screen.

Once you get there, you will have to fill the following:

- **Configuration name**: A friendly label for a staff user to distinct specific configurations, for example, “Staging” and “Prod”
- **Merchant Code, SP Code, Terminal ID**: you will receive those credentials while enrolling in NP
- **Shipping company code**: this field indicates which shipping carrier should appear in the fulfillment reports.

You can also enable or disable following options:
- **Use sandbox:** when enabled, transactions will be targeting the NP test environment.
- **Product SKU as name:** by default, Saleor is using the product name as a description of the line item. You can use this option to use SKU instead.

## Mapping configuration to channel

One configuration is added, you will be able to assign it to the channel. Once it happens, the app should be operational.
