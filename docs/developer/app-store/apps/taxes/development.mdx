# Development

To run the Taxes App locally:

1. Follow the [_Saleor Apps_ section in the _App Examples_ article](../../extending/apps/developing-apps/app-examples#saleor-apps).
2. Go to the app directory.
3. Copy the `.env.example` file to `.env`.The `.env` should contain the following variables:

:::info

Taxes is a Next.js application. If you want to learn more about setting environment variables in Next.js, head over to the [documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/environment-variables).

:::

`SECRET_KEY` (_optional_)

A randomly generated key for the encryption of [Settings Manager](https://github.com/saleor/saleor-app-sdk/blob/main/docs/settings-manager.md).

Although it is not required in the development, we recommend to set it. If not set, a random key will be generated on each app start.

`APL` (_optional_)

Name of the chosen implementation of the [Authentication Persistence Layer](https://github.com/saleor/saleor-app-sdk/blob/main/docs/apl.md).

When no value is provided, `FileAPL` is used by default. See `saleor-app.ts` in the app directory to see supported APLs.

`APP_LOG_LEVEL` (_optional_)

Logging level based on which the app will decide on what messages to log.

The possible values are: `trace`, `debug`, `info`, `warn`, `error`, `fatal`, `silent`. The default value is `silent` which means no logs will be printed.

You can read more about our logger in [its documentation](https://getpino.io/#/docs/api?id=loggerlevel-string-gettersetter).

`ALLOWED_DOMAIN_PATTERN` (_optional_)

A regex pattern that prohibits the app from being installed on a Saleor instance that does not match the pattern. If not set, all installations will be allowed.
