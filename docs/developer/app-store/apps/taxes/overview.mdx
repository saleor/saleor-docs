_Taxes_ is a Saleor app that allows delegating tax calculations to external tax providers. It can replace the default ([flat rates](developer/taxes.mdx#flat-rates)) tax calculation method in Saleor. It affects both the checkout and the order creation process.

The currently supported providers are:

- [TaxJar](https://www.taxjar.com/)
- [AvaTax](https://www.avalara.com/us/en/index.html)
- [AvaTax Excise](https://developer.avalara.com/excise/) [_coming soon_]
- [Stripe Tax](https://stripe.com/tax) [_coming soon_]

## Features

Taxes App offers:

- Integrations with AvaTax and TaxJar
- Calculating taxes for order and checkout
- Creating multiple configurations for each provider and using them in different channels
- [Mapping tax codes from your tax provider to Saleor tax classes](tax-codes)

### AvaTax

Besides the shared features, AvaTax integration also offers:

- [Managing document recording](avatax/overview#document-recording)
- [Mapping the entity type](avatax/overview#entity-type)
- [Mapping the document code](avatax/overview#document-code)
- [Mapping the tax calculation date](avatax/overview#tax-calculation-date)
- Voiding transaction on [`OrderCancelled`](api-reference/orders/objects/order-cancelled.mdx) event

## Architecture

If you want to explore how the Taxes App work, you can read the [Taxes App architecture](architecture) article.

## Configuration

### Channels

For a channel to appear on the _Available channels_ list, you must first select **"use tax app"** as its tax calculation method. You can do that on the _Tax Configuration_ page (_Configuration_ â†’ _Taxes_).

In the _Taxes_ page, select the channel and change the value of _Select the method of tax calculation_ to "_Use tax app_". Then save it and come back to the Taxes App.

### Providers

In the _Tax providers_ section, you can manage your tax provider instances. Each tax provider instance is a different configuration for a specific tax provider.

You can find instructions for configuring providers on their individual pages:

- [TaxJar](taxjar/overview#configuration)
- [AvaTax](avatax/overview#configuration)
