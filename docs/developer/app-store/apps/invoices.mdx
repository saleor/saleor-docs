The Invoices app allows you to generate simple PDF invoice files for every order in your store.

## Features

Generates a PDF file when an invoice is requested (in the Dashboard or with an API). Then attaches it to the order.

The invoice shop address can be inherited from the [Shop](../../../api-reference/miscellaneous/objects/shop) settings or configured manually per channel.

## Assumptions & limitations

- The PDF template is fixed and can't be changed by the user.
- The PDF template is in English only.

## Permissions

The App requires `MANAGE_ORDERS` permission to be able to:

- Receive the `INVOICE_REQUESTED` webhook
- Read order data to generate the invoice
- Attach the invoice to the order

The staff user configuring the App must have `MANAGE_APPS` and `MANAGE_ORDERS` permissions.

## Application flow

The App reacts on a single webhook, and it ends its flow once a PDF file is attached to the order.

See the detailed flow below:

sequenceDiagram
    Saleor->>+App: Trigger INVOICE_REQUESTED
    App->>+App: Generate a PDF file in memory
    App->>+Saleor: Upload a PDF file
    Saleor->>+App: Provide a link to the PDF file
    App->>+Saleor: Attach a link to the PDF file to the Order
```

## Configuration

The app allows to configure a shop address per each channel separately.

If the channel is not configured, the app will fetch the Shop address from settings and use it.

### Testing

To verify if the app works:

1. Ensure the "Invoices" legacy plugin is disabled; otherwise, duplicated invoices can be generated.
2. Ensure the App is installed and enabled.
3. Optionally configure the custom address. If the custom address is not configured, fill [Shop address](../../../api-reference/miscellaneous/objects/shop) in the Dashboard settings.
4. Find any order in the Dashboard, find the "Invoices" section, and click the "Generate" button.
5. Wait a couple of seconds and refresh the dashboard.
6. The invoice should be attached to the order in the "Invoices" section.

## Troubleshooting

- During development with Saleor running locally, there are file uploading issues; see [this issue](https://github.com/saleor/apps/issues/285).

Check [Github issues](https://github.com/saleor/apps/labels/App%3A%20Invoices) to see up to date list of known issues or to report a new one.

## Development

Visit the [development guide](../../extending/apps/developing-apps/app-examples) to learn more about App Store app development.

### Env variables

Apart from common env variables, the Invoice app accepts the following:

- `TEMP_PDF_STORAGE_DIR=` - a temp directory where the PDF files will be stored. In Vercel, set `/tmp`. Add it to `.gitignore`

## Migration from the _Invoicing_ plugin

The Invoices App covers the functionality of the plugin. In the future, plugins will be deprecated and replaced by apps. To migrate from plugin to app, follow the steps below:

1. Install the Invoices App from the App Store (Dashboard -> Apps).
2. Open the installed App.
3. Verify the default shop billing address. It will be fetched from [Shop Settings](../../../api-reference/miscellaneous/objects/shop).
4. Verify per-channel shop address settings. It will use the default one but can be overridden.
5. Open a test order in the Dashboard.
6. Click the "Generate" button in the "Invoices" section.
7. Wait for two PDF files to generate: one from the plugin and the second from the app. You may need to refresh the page.
8. Compare generated PDF files, and ensure all required information is available on the app-generated invoice.
9. Disable the Invoicing plugin.

### Differences between the plugin and the app

- The invoice name is different. The plugin uses the _invoice_ creation date; the app uses the _order_ creation date.
- The invoice template is different. The app additionally displays the Seller (shop) address. The shipping is displayed as a line item.
