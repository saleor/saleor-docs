You can find more information how to modify product feed in [Google Merchant Center](https://shoppingsolutions.withgoogle.com/expertise/merchant-center-modify/).

## Overview

_Product Feed_ app allows generating an XML file with products and their details. The file can be used as a feed source for Google Merchant Center.

## Features

- Generate XML file with products and their details
- Allow to store feed file in S3 bucket
- Generating separate feeds for each channel
- Possibility to map Saleor categories to pre-defined Google categories
- Map Saleor attributes to Google attributes

## Limitations

The app is able to handle a maximum ~2300 variants per sales channel of your product catalogue.
After reaching that limit, only that amount will be included in the feed.

## Permissions

The app requires `MANAGE_PRODUCTS` permission to listen to product events.

To save app configuration, staff users must have `MANAGE_PRODUCTS` permission.

## Configuration

### S3 bucket

In case you want to send the generated file to the S3 bucket, you need to provide the following details:

- `AWS Access Key ID`
- `AWS Secret`
- `AWS S3 Bucket Name`
- `AWS S3 Bucket Region`

You can test the connection to the S3 bucket by clicking the `Test connection` button.

### Channels

You can generate a separate feed for each channel. To do that, you need to provide the following details:

- `Storefront URL`
- `Storefront product URL`

### Item title

You can use the [`Handerbars`](https://handlebarsjs.com/) format to customize the product URL with context-aware templates.

You can use variables like this:

#### Example:

For this url `https://my-shop.com/p/{{ variant.product.slug }}/{{ variant.id }}` will produce `https://my-shop.com/p/t-shirt/Xyp2asZ`

### Categories mapping

You can map Saleor categories to pre-defined Google categories, but this is optional.
Selected Google Category Id will be saved in Category public metadata.
Google automatically assigns a category to a product, but in some cases, Google allows to override it.
You can find more information [here](https://support.google.com/merchants/answer/6324436?hl=en)

### Attributes mapping

Choose which product attributes should be used for the feed.

Supported attributes:

- `brand`
- `color`
- `material`
- `pattern`
- `size`
- `gtin`

## Testing

- In the channel configuration section, select a channel for which you want to generate a feed
- Provide required URLs for storefront and product
- Below in the same section, in the `Test your feed` subsection click on the button `Open feed in a new tab`
- New tab should open, wait a couple of seconds for the generated feed
