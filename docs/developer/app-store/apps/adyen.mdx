# Adyen

## Overview

Adyen App is a payment integration app that allows merchants using the Saleor e-commerce platform to accept online payments from customers using Adyen as their payment processor. In addition to processing payments, the Saleor App Payment Adyen provides merchants with tools for managing refunds and chargebacks.

:::caution

To configure the Adyen App, you must have an account with [Adyen](https://www.adyen.com).

:::

The Adyen App allows for integrations with [Adyen Web Drop-in](https://docs.adyen.com/online-payments/web-drop-in/additional-use-cases/advanced-flow), [Adyen iOS Drop-in](https://docs.adyen.com/online-payments/ios/drop-in/additional-use-cases/advanced-flow), [Adyen Android Drop-in](https://docs.adyen.com/online-payments/android/drop-in), and [Adyen React Native Drop-in](https://docs.adyen.com/online-payments/react-native/drop-in). It uses the [Adyen Drop-in Advanced Flow](https://docs.adyen.com/online-payments/web-drop-in/additional-use-cases/advanced-flow).

:::info

Adyen App uses Adyen [Checkout API v70](https://docs.adyen.com/api-explorer/#/CheckoutService/v70/overview) and [Management API v1](https://docs.adyen.com/api-explorer/#/ManagementService/v1/overview).

:::

## Capabilities

The Adyen App implements the following [Saleor sync webhooks related to transactions](../../extending/apps/synchronous-webhooks/transaction-webhooks):

- [`PAYMENT_GATEWAY_INITIALIZE_SESSION`](../../../api-reference/webhooks/enums/webhook-event-type-sync-enum#code-style-fontweight-normal-webhookeventtypesyncenumbpayment_gateway_initialize_sessionbcode)
- [`TRANSACTION_INITIALIZE_SESSION`](../../../api-reference/webhooks/enums/webhook-event-type-sync-enum.mdx#code-style-fontweight-normal-webhookeventtypesyncenumbtransaction_initialize_sessionbcode)
- [`TRANSACTION_PROCESS_SESSION`](../../../api-reference/webhooks/enums/webhook-event-type-sync-enum.mdx#code-style-fontweight-normal-webhookeventtypesyncenumbtransaction_process_sessionbcode)
- [`TRANSACTION_CHARGE_REQUESTED`](../../../api-reference/webhooks/enums/webhook-event-type-sync-enum#code-style-fontweight-normal-webhookeventtypesyncenumbtransaction_charge_requestedbcode)
- [`TRANSACTION_CANCEL_REQUESTED`](../../../api-reference/webhooks/enums/webhook-event-type-sync-enum#code-style-fontweight-normal-webhookeventtypesyncenumbtransaction_cancelation_requestedbcode)
- [`TRANSACTION_REFUND_REQUESTED`](../../../api-reference/webhooks/enums/webhook-event-type-sync-enum#code-style-fontweight-normal-webhookeventtypesyncenumbtransaction_refund_requestedbcode)

Furthermore, it's also prepared to handle [async Adyen webhooks](https://docs.adyen.com/development-resources/webhooks).

Adyen App follows the flow described in detail in the [Saleor Payment App documentation](../../payments#saleor-payment-app).

## Configuration

For Adyen to appear as [available payment gateway](../../checkout/finalizing#listing-available-payment-gateways), you need to [install it in the Saleor Dashboard](../overview#usage). You must obtain the API key from Adyen and paste it into the Adyen App configuration form. Then, a wizard will guide you through the process of configuring the Adyen App, setting up the webhook to receive notifications from Adyen, generating the HMAC key, and adding allowed origins for the Client Key that's used on your Storefront.

:::caution

API Key provided inside the configuration must have the following permissions set in Adyen Dashboard:

- "Management API - Accounts read and write"
- "Management API - API credentials read and write"
- "Management API - Payment methods read"
- "Management API - Stores read and write"
- "Management API - Webhooks read and write"
- "Checkout encrypted cardholder data"
- "Merchant Recurring role"
- "Checkout webservice role"
- "Merchant PAL Webservice role"

:::

## Usage in Storefront or mobile apps

Adyen App can be used to integrate with Adyen APIs. By using a set of GraphQL mutations, one can interact with Adyen to authorize, capture, refund, and cancel payments.

### Getting payment gateways

The first step is to fetch the Checkout object including [`availablePaymentGateways`](../../../api-reference/checkout/objects/checkout#code-style-fontweight-normal-checkoutbavailablepaymentgatewaysbcodepaymentgateway---) field. The `availablePaymentGateways` field contains a list of payment gateways available for given checkout. The Adyen App should be one of the payment gateways available in the list. Its `id` is [`app.saleor.adyen`](https://adyen.saleor.app/api/manifest) - defined in app's manifest.

```graphql
query {
  checkout(id: "Q2hlY2tvdXQ6YWY3MDJkMGQtMzM0NC00NjMxLTlkNmEtMDk4Yzk1ODhlNmMy") {
    availablePaymentGateways {
      id
      name
    }
  }
}
```

The response:

```json
{
  "data": {
    "checkout": {
      "availablePaymentGateways": [
        {
          "id": "app.saleor.adyen",
          "name": "Adyen"
        }
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

:::note

`availablePaymentGateways` may contain other Payment Apps as well as older [Payment Gateways (plugins)](../../../developer/extending/payment-gateways) configured in the Dashboard. You should ignore the ones that you don't want to use for a specific checkout.

:::

### Obtaining Adyen payment methods

Next, you need to fetch configured payment methods from Adyen. To do that, use the [`paymentGatewayInitialize`](../../../api-reference/payments/mutations/payment-gateway-initialize) mutation. The mutation returns a `PaymentGatewayInitialize` object with `data` field containing a list of payment methods. The `data` field is an object with the following fields:

```ts
{
  paymentMethodsResponse: PaymentMethodsResponse;
  clientKey: string;
  environment: "LIVE" | "TEST";
  errors?: SyncWebhookAppErrors;
}
```

Where `PaymentMethodsResponse` is the result of calling Adyen's `/paymentMethods` endpoint and is described in the [Adyen documentation](https://docs.adyen.com/api-explorer/Checkout/latest/post/paymentMethods#responses-200). `SyncWebhookAppErrors` is [described below](#handling-errors).

If `errors` field doesn't exist or is an empty array, `paymentMethodsResponse`, `clientKey` and `environment` should be used to initialize [Adyen Drop-in](https://docs.adyen.com/online-payments/web-drop-in/additional-use-cases/advanced-flow).

```graphql
mutation {
  paymentGatewayInitialize(
    id: "Q2hlY2tvdXQ6YWY3MDJkMGQtMzM0NC00NjMxLTlkNmEtMDk4Yzk1ODhlNmMy"
    amount: 54.24
    paymentGateways: [{ id: "app.saleor.adyen" }]
  ) {
    gatewayConfigs {
      id
      data
      errors {
        field
        message
        code
      }
    }
    errors {
      field
      message
      code
    }
  }
}
```

The response:

```json
{
  "data": {
    "paymentGatewayInitialize": {
      "gatewayConfigs": [
        {
          "id": "app.saleor.adyen",
          "data": {
            "paymentMethodsResponse": {
              "paymentMethods": [
                {
                  "brands": ["visa", "mc"],
                  "name": "Credit Card",
                  "type": "scheme"
                }
              ]
            },
            "clientKey": "test_AHSJKADHK12731KDSALD11DSADASA003",
            "environment": "TEST"
          },
          "errors": []
        }
      ],
      "errors": []
    }
  }
}
```

:::tip

For instructions on how to add, remove or constraint payment methods from Adyen, please consult the [Adyen payment methods documentation](https://docs.adyen.com/payment-methods).

:::

### Paying with Adyen

After a user has interacted with the Adyen Drop-in and entered payment details, [Drop-in event data along with other information](https://docs.adyen.com/online-payments/web-drop-in/additional-use-cases/advanced-flow#step-3-make-a-payment) should be passed to the [`transactionInitialize`](../../../api-reference/payments/mutations/transaction-initialize) mutation as the `paymentGateway.data` field. The mutation returns the `TransactionInitialize` object with a `data` field containing the following fields:

```ts
{
  paymentResponse: PaymentResponse;
  errors?: SyncWebhookAppErrors;
}
```

Where `PaymentResponse` is the result of calling Adyen's `/payments` endpoint and is described in the [Adyen documentation](https://docs.adyen.com/api-explorer/Checkout/latest/post/payments#responses-200). `SyncWebhookAppErrors` is [described below](#handling-errors).

If the `errors` field doesn't exist or is an empty array, pass the `paymentResponse` to Adyen Drop-in. The Drop-in will handle the response and display the result to the user or require additional actions to proceed.

```graphql
mutation AdyenTransactionInitialize($data: JSON!) {
  transactionInitialize(
    id: "Q2hlY2tvdXQ6YWY3MDJkMGQtMzM0NC00NjMxLTlkNmEtMDk4Yzk1ODhlNmMy"
    action: AUTHORIZATION
    amount: 54.24
    paymentGateway: { id: "app.saleor.adyen", data: $data }
  ) {
    transactionEvent {
      pspReference
      amount {
        amount
        currency
      }
      type
    }
    data
    errors {
      field
      message
      code
    }
  }
}
```

Where `$data` is the object provided by Adyen Drop-in in the `onSubmit` (Web, React Native), `didSubmit` (iOS) or `makePaymentsCall` (Android) callback. Response:

```json
{
  "data": {
    "transactionInitialize": {
      "transactionEvent": {
        "pspReference": "XXXX9XXXXXXXXX99",
        "amount": {
          "amount": 54.24,
          "currency": "EUR"
        },
        "type": "AUTHORIZATION_SUCCESS"
      },
      "data": {
        "paymentResponse": {
          "additionalData": {
            "paymentMethod": "visa"
          },
          "amount": {
            "currency": "EUR",
            "value": 5424
          },
          "merchantReference": "SOME_MERCHANT_ID_",
          "paymentMethod": {
            "brand": "visa",
            "type": "scheme"
          },
          "pspReference": "XXXX9XXXXXXXXX99",
          "resultCode": "Authorised"
        }
      },
      "errors": []
    }
  }
}
```

### Performing additional actions (_optional_)

Optionally, additional actions may be required: authentication of payment with 3D Secure, scan of a QR code, or logging in to the bank to complete the payment. In this case, [`transactionProcess`](../../../api-reference/payments/mutations/transaction-process) mutation should be used. The mutation returns a `TransactionProcess` object with a `data` field containing the following fields:

```ts
{
  paymentDetailsResponse: PaymentDetailsResponse
  errors?: SyncWebhookAppErrors;
}
```

Where `PaymentDetailsResponse` is the result of calling Adyen's `/payments/details` endpoint and is described in the [Adyen documentation](https://docs.adyen.com/api-explorer/Checkout/latest/post/payments/details#responses-200). `SyncWebhookAppErrors` is [described below](#handling-errors).

If the `errors` field doesn't exist or is an empty array, pass the `paymentDetailsResponse` back to Adyen Drop-in. The Drop-in will handle the response and display the result to the user or again require additional actions to proceed.

Repeat the step until the payment is successful or fails.

:::caution

Many payment methods are not settled synchronously. Sometimes it takes seconds, minutes, hours, or even days for a payment to go through. Adyen App will automatically handle Adyen webhook notifications and create transaction events in Saleor (see [`transactionEventReport`](../../../api-reference/payments/mutations/transaction-event-report)).

:::

### Apple Pay `onValidateMerchant`

In case you want to implement Apple Pay integration through Adyen and use your own Apple Pay certificate, you need to implement `onValidateMerchant` (Web, React Native) or `onvalidatemerchant` (iOS). Saleor App Adyen provides a way to validate the merchant through the `paymentGatewayInitialize` mutation:

```graphql
mutation PaymentGatewayInitialize($checkoutId: ID!, $data: JSON) {
  paymentGatewayInitialize(
    paymentGateways: [{ id: "app.saleor.adyen", data: $data }]
    id: $checkoutId
  ) {
    gatewayConfigs {
      id
      data
      errors {
        field
        message
        code
      }
    }
    errors {
      field
      message
      code
    }
  }
}
```

and provide the following JSON in `$data`:

```json
{
  "action": "APPLEPAY_onvalidatemerchant",
  "validationURL": "…",
  "domain": "…",
  "merchantIdentifier": "…",
  "merchantName": "…"
}
```

All the parameters should be provided according to [Apple Pay documentation on the Adyen website](https://docs.adyen.com/payment-methods/apple-pay/web-drop-in?tab=_code_payments_code__2#page-introduction).

### Additional endpoints (optional)

To use some payment methods inside Adyen Drop-in you may have to implement the following callbacks:

- `onBalanceCheck` (Web, React Native), `checkBalance` (iOS) or `checkBalance` (Android)
- `onOrderRequest` (Web, React Native), `requestOrder` (iOS) or `createOrder` (Android)
- `onOrderCancel` (Web, React Native), `cancelOrder` (iOS) or `cancelOrder` (Android)

For example, these methods are required for [Gift card split-payments](https://docs.adyen.com/payment-methods/gift-cards/web-drop-in?tab=config-payments_2#required-configuration).

:::note

Adyen's orders and requests for balance checks are not saved in Saleor. Each payment linked to Adyen's order will be stored as a separate transaction in Saleor.

Orders link transactions on the Adyen level. For example, if a user cancels an order (by removing gift card payment inside the Drop-in), every payment linked to that order will be refunded or voided.

:::

#### `onBalanceCheck`

To call the `/paymentMethods/balance` endpoint use the `paymentGatewayInitialize` mutation:

```graphql
mutation PaymentGatewayInitialize($checkoutId: ID!, $data: JSON) {
  paymentGatewayInitialize(
    paymentGateways: [{ id: "app.saleor.adyen", data: $data }]
    id: $checkoutId
  ) {
    gatewayConfigs {
      id
      data
      errors {
        field
        message
        code
      }
    }
    errors {
      field
      message
      code
    }
  }
}
```

and provide the following JSON in `$data`:

```json
{
  "action": "checkBalance",
  "paymentMethod": {
    "type": "giftcard",
    "brand": "givex",
    "encryptedCardNumber": "...",
    "encryptedSecurityCode": "..."
  }
}
```

The contents of the `paymentMethod` field come from the Adyen Drop-in.

Example `onBalanceCheck` implementation in TypeScript could look like this (depending on your GraphQL client):

```ts
async onBalanceCheck(resolve, reject, data) {
  const {
    paymentGatewayInitialize: { gatewayConfigs },
  } = await client.request(PaymentGatewayInitialize, {
    checkoutId,
    data: { action: "checkBalance", paymentMethod: data.paymentMethod },
  });
  const response = gatewayConfigs[0].data.giftCardBalanceResponse;
  resolve(response);
}
```

:::note

Error handling is intentionally omitted for brevity.

:::

The response received from Saleor with data from the Adyen app will be:

```json
{
  "data": {
    "paymentGatewayInitialize": {
      "gatewayConfigs": [
        {
          "id": "app.saleor.adyen",
          "data": {
            "giftCardBalanceResponse": {
              "balance": {
                "currency": "EUR",
                "value": 5000
              },
              "pspReference": "BK4C…NN82",
              "resultCode": "NotEnoughBalance"
            }
          }
        }
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

#### `onOrderRequest`

Similarly to `onBalanceCheck`, to call the `/orders` endpoint use the `paymentGatewayInitialize` mutation and pass the following `$data`:

```json
{
  "action": "createOrder"
}
```

The `onOrderCreate` implementation in TypeScript could look like this (depending on your GraphQL client):

```ts
async onOrderCreate(resolve, reject, data) {
  const {
    paymentGatewayInitialize: { gatewayConfigs },
  } = await client.request(PaymentGatewayInitialize, {
    id: checkoutId,
    data: { action: "createOrder" },
  });
  const response = gatewayConfigs[0].data.orderCreateResponse;
  resolve(response);
}
```

The response received from Saleor with data from the `/orders` endpoint will be:

```json
{
  "data": {
    "paymentGatewayInitialize": {
      "gatewayConfigs": [
        {
          "id": "app.saleor.adyen",
          "data": {
            "orderCreateResponse": {
              "amount": {
                "currency": "EUR",
                "value": 12000
              },
              "expiresAt": "2023-07-04T11:34:02Z",
              "orderData": "...",
              "pspReference": "W...82",
              "reference": "Checkout:Q2hlY2…jM1OGJm",
              "remainingAmount": {
                "currency": "EUR",
                "value": 12000
              },
              "resultCode": "Success"
            }
          }
        }
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

Once the order is created, you may complete the payment. Use the data received from the Drop-in inside the `onSubmit` method.
It includes the `order` property - Adyen App will charge the customer with the amount specified in the order's data.

For example: if you have only 20 EUR left on a gift card, and the order's total amount is 50 EUR, `order` data will firstly charge the gift card with the available amount (20 EUR) and the 2nd payment method with the outstanding order amount (50 - 20 = 30 EUR).

#### `onOrderCancel`

Should be called when the user removes a payment method in a pending Adyen order, for example when there was already a partial charge for a gift card but the user decided to use a different payment method.

To call the `/orders/cancel` endpoint use the `transactionProcess` mutation:

```graphql
mutation TransactionProcess($id: ID!, $data: JSON!) {
  transactionProcess(id: $id, data: $data) {
    data
  }
}
```

and provide the following `$data`:

```json
{
  "action": "cancelOrder"
}
```

The response from that mutation will be:

```json
{
  "data": {
    "transactionProcess": {
      "data": {
        "orderCancelResponse": {
          "pspReference": "...",
          "resultCode": "Received"
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### Handling errors

The three mutations described above may return `data.errors` field. The existence of this field determines that the request was unsuccessful. `errors` is an array of `SyncWebhookAppError` objects. The `SyncWebhookAppError` object has the following fields:

```ts
{
  code?: string;
  message?: string;
  details?: JSONObject;
}
```

The `code` field is a string identifying the error. One of the following values is allowed:

- `UnknownError`
- `JsonSchemaError`
- `MissingSaleorApiUrlError`
- `MissingAuthDataError`
- `HttpClientError`

:::note

This list may be extended in the future. Make sure your app handles unknown error codes.

:::

The `message` field is a human-readable message describing the error.

The `details` field is an object containing additional information about the error. It may contain two fields:

- `errorCode` – [Adyen error code](https://docs.adyen.com/development-resources/error-codes)
- `statusCode` – [Adyen HTTP status code](https://docs.adyen.com/development-resources/response-handling)

Example:

```json
{
  "data": {
    "transactionInitialize": {
      "transactionEvent": {
        "pspReference": "",
        "amount": {
          "amount": 54.24,
          "currency": "EUR"
        },
        "type": "AUTHORIZATION_FAILURE"
      },
      "data": {
        "errors": [
          {
            "code": "HttpClientError",
            "message": "HTTP Exception: 422. : Unable to decrypt data",
            "details": {
              "errorCode": "174",
              "statusCode": 422
            }
          }
        ],
        "paymentResponse": {}
      },
      "errors": []
    }
  }
}
```

## Development

To run the Adyen App locally:

1. Go to the app directory.
2. Copy the `.env.example` file to `.env`.The `.env` should contain the following variables:

:::info

Adyen App is a Next.js application. If you want to learn more about setting environment variables in Next.js, head over to the [documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/environment-variables).

:::

`SECRET_KEY` (_required_)

A randomly generated key for the encryption of [Settings Manager](https://github.com/saleor/saleor-app-sdk/blob/main/docs/settings-manager.md). At least 8 characters long.

`APL` (_optional_)

Name of the chosen implementation of the [Authentication Persistence Layer](https://github.com/saleor/saleor-app-sdk/blob/main/docs/apl.md).

When no value is provided, `FileAPL` is used by default. See `saleor-app.ts` in the app directory to see supported APLs.

`APP_DEBUG` (_optional_)

The logging level for the app. The possible values are: `trace`, `debug`, `info`, `warn`, `error`, `fatal`, and `silent`. The default value is `info` which means that some information will be logged into the console.

You can read more about our logger in [its documentation](https://getpino.io/#/docs/api?id=loggerlevel-string-gettersetter).

### Running app in development mode

To run the app in development mode, run the following command:

```bash
pnpm i
pnpm dev
```

:::note

pnpm 8.0.0 or higher is required to run the app.

:::

The app will be available at `http://localhost:3000`.

:::info

To test Adyen Webhooks, you need to expose your local server to the internet (tunnel). You can use Saleor CLI to do that. See [this guide](../../extending/apps/developing-with-tunnels) for more details.

:::

### Running tests

To run tests, one needs to provide additional environment variables. Copy the `.env.test` file to `.env.test.local`.The `.env.test.local` should contain the following variables:
