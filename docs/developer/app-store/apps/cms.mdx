## Overview

:::note V2 version This document describes the v2 version of the app. The v1
version is deprecated and will be removed in the future.
:::

_CMS_ is a Saleor app that allows one-direction synchronization of Saleor products into supported CMS platforms. Here are the currently available platforms:

- [Contentful](https://www.contentful.com/)
- [Strapi](https://strapi.io/)
- [DatoCMS](https://www.datocms.com/)
- [Builder.io](https://www.builder.io/)
- [Payload](https://payloadcms.com/)

### Features

The app allows you to:

- Connect one or more CMS platforms.
- Perform initial synch of all products from Saleor to the CMS platform.
- Automatically synchronize product updates from Saleor to the CMS platform via events/webhooks.
- Configure multiple CMS configurations and assign them to channels.

### Main assumptions & limitations

- The app is unidirectional. It means it will only send product updates from Saleor to the CMS platform. If you change data in the CMS, it will not be reflected in Saleor.
- The app considers [Product Variant](../../../api-reference/products/objects/product-variant) as a main synchronized entity. Every created item in the CMS will be a single, unique variant of the product.
- The app requires you to create a model in the CMS platform, but you can map Saleor product fields to the CMS fields.
- The app will synchronize product variants on the following [events](../../../developer/extending/webhooks/asynchronous-events):
  - `PRODUCT_UPDATED`
  - `PRODUCT_VARIANT_CREATED`
  - `PRODUCT_VARIANT_UPDATED`
  - `PRODUCT_VARIANT_DELETED`
- If the CMS platform allows that, the App will create an item with an ID that equals Saleor's product variant ID. If not, it will reference the product by mapped variant id field.
- Bulk / initial sync runs only on the frontend. This is usually a one-time operation, but the browser must be opened. In case of a connection problem, the operation can fail.
  You can read more about this [below](#initial-syncbulk-sync).
- If **UNIQUE** attribute is not set on the variant ID field in the CMS, there will be no guarantee that duplicates will not be created.

You can find more details about specific CMS platforms behavior below.

### Synchronized data

The app will synchronize the following fields:

- Variant id
- Variant name
- Variant channels availability and prices
- Product id
- Product name
- Product slug

That means _variant id_ field should be unique among synchronized product variants. Other fields may be the same among variants.

:::caution
Most CMS platform allows setting **UNIQUE** constraint/validation on some fields. **It's highly recommended** to set this attribute on Variant ID field.

If the attribute is not set, the App will not guarantee that duplicates will not be created.

## Glossary

The app uses the following terms:

### Provider

The provider is a CMS platform that is supported by the app.

### Provider configuration

Provider configuration is an instance of the configured provider.
Usually, it contains credentials and field mapping. The app allows multiple configurations of the same provider.

For example, you can connect your CMS platform's production and staging setup or have different configurations for each channel.

### Provider-channel connection

The app allows you to connect a provider configuration to the Saleor channel.
Once it happens, product operations in Saleor will automatically send product updates to the provider with chosen configuration.

This step is optional, but you will likely want to connect the provider configuration to the channel.

:::caution Connecting many channels
If you want to connect many channels to the same provider configuration, you must create a separate connection for each channel using the same provider configuration.
:::

### Initial sync/bulk sync

The app does not automatically synchronize the products that were created before its installation. If you want to import all the Saleor products into your CMS, you must perform an initial sync.

To execute the initial sync, you must have at least one connection configured. You can then use it to scan the entire Saleor database for products and send them to the provider.

:::caution Limitation
At the moment, the App performs bulk sync on the front end. That means when this is happening, the App must stay open. Closing the window will stop the operation.
:::

## Configuration

To configure the app, follow the instructions built into the app.

Usually, you will need to perform the following steps:

1. Create a provider configuration for the chosen provider.
2. Assign the created configuration to a selected channel.
3. Perform an initial sync.
4. Edit or create some product variant to see if it is synchronized with the provider.

:::caution

To successfully configure the CMS App, you must have an account with a supported CMS platform.

:::

### CMS fields setup

The App allows you to map Saleor product fields to the CMS fields.
Some providers allow the App to fetch and display the available fields in an autocomplete. If autocomplete is unavailable, you must ensure the field names are correct.

## CMS Providers

Each of the CMS platforms has slight differences in configuration and behavior due to their APIs and limitations.

### Contentful

- Fields are autocompleted after you provide [space ID](https://www.contentful.com/help/find-space-id/) and a [token](https://www.contentful.com/help/personal-access-tokens/).
- Entries will be created with ID autogenerated by Contentful. You should set the variant ID field to be unique.
- Bulk sync operations are limited to 2 items per second due to Contentful API limitations.
- All fields must be the type of `string/text`, except `channels`, which should be type `json`.

### [DatoCMS](https://www.datocms.com/)

- Fields are autocompleted after you provide a full-access [API token (Content Management API)](https://www.datocms.com/docs/content-management-api/authentication).
- Entries will be created with IDs generated by DatoCMS. You should set the variant ID field to be unique.
- Bulk sync operations will be rate-limited by DatoCMS client itself.
- All fields must be the type of `string/text`, except `channels`, which should be type `json`.

### [Strapi](https://strapi.io/)

:::caution

The Saleor CMS App is currently compatible only with Strapi v4. It will not synchronize data properly with Strapi v5.

:::

- Fields are not autocompleted. You must provide an auth token with full access to the product variant entity and API base URL (without `/api` suffix).
- Item type must be plural, eg, `saleor-products` instead `saleor-product`.
- All fields must be the type of `string/text`, except `channels`, which should be type `json`.

### [Builder.io](https://www.builder.io/)

- Fields are not autocompleted. You must ensure mapping is correct.
- Builder.io doesn't support unique constraints on fields - hence the app will not guarantee that duplicates will not be created.

### [Payload](https://payloadcms.com/)

Payload CMS requires some extra steps to be performed before the app can be used.

The app uses [Payload's REST API](https://payloadcms.com/docs/rest-api/overview), by default enabled in Payload.
Typically, it's available under `/api` path. You are going to need this URL.

Then, read about [authorization in Payload](https://payloadcms.com/docs/authentication/config). It's not required, but it is recommended to set up authorization between the app and Payload.

To do that, you need to create a user collection with `useAPIKey` field enabled. This will expose an infinite API key in Payload admin panel. You are going to need this key too.

The user collection used for authentication has a slug (set from the coded configuration) - this field name is also required in the app configuration.

Lastly, you need to create a collection for product variants. The app will create items in this collection. Please create all corresponding fields and ensure the one for _variant id_ is configured as unique.

The product variant collection slug is also required to configure the app.

If you want to play with the app without authorization, you need to set all access rights (read, write, create, delete) to "true" (public access) in Payload.

If auth is set in the app, the app will attach the API key to the requests, and it's on you to configure Payload to accept it. Usually, its enough to check if `request.user` exists.

Payload fields should be set to "text" type, except "channels" which should be "json".

:::caution

Field correctness is not validated. Ensure you set the correct values.

:::

To configure the app, you need to fill in the fields in the form:

- API URL - the REST API URL (usually ending with `/api`)
- Authorization - user slug and API key. Both of them should be filled in to enable authorization. Leave blank if Payload is configured with public access.
- Collection slug - the name of the collection where product variants will be created.
- Fields mapping - names of fields in the collection. Saleor will sync product data to these fields.

## Troubleshooting

### I see a lot of network errors in the console

It's expected. Some providers are rate-limited, and the app will retry the operation. Sometimes app will try to create an item in CMS and in case of conflict, it will retry with an _update_ operation.

### I see duplicated variants in CMS

Ensure you set the _unique_ attribute on the CMS field where the variant ID is stored. This will prevent the app from creating a product already created.
The app will try to update it instead of creating it.

## Development

To run the CMS App locally:

1. Follow the [_Running Saleor Apps locally_ article](/developer/extending/apps/developing-apps/running-saleor-apps-locally).
2. Go to the app directory.
3. Copy the `.env.example` file to `.env`. The `.env` should contain the following variables:

:::info

CMS is a Next.js application. If you want to learn more about setting environment variables in Next.js, head over to the [documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/environment-variables).

:::

`SECRET_KEY` (_required_)

A randomly generated key that encrypts metadata stored in Saleor. At least eight characters long.

`APL` (_optional_)

Name of the chosen implementation of the [Authentication Persistence Layer](https://github.com/saleor/saleor-app-sdk/blob/main/docs/apl.md).

When no value is provided, `FileAPL` is used by default. See `saleor-app.ts` in the app directory to see supported APLs.

`APP_LOG_LEVEL` (_optional_)

Logging level based on which the app will decide on what messages to log.

The possible values are: `trace`, `debug`, `info`, `warn`, `error`, `fatal`, `silent`. The default value is `silent` which means no logs will be printed.

You can read more about our logger in [its documentation](https://getpino.io/#/docs/api?id=loggerlevel-string-gettersetter).

`ALLOWED_DOMAIN_PATTERN` (_optional_)

A regex pattern that prohibits the app from being installed on a Saleor instance that does not match the pattern. If not set, all installations will be allowed.
