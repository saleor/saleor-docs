You can find the code for all the apps from the Saleor App Store in the [`saleor/apps` monorepo](https://github.com/saleor/apps).

Each app is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/docs/getting-started) application based off [saleor-app-template](https://github.com/saleor/saleor-app-template).

In this article, you will learn how to run the Saleor App Store apps locally.

## Prerequisites

To work with the `saleor/apps` repository, you need to install [`pnpm`](https://pnpm.io/). If you haven't already, please do so by running:

```bash
npm install -g pnpm
```

## Setup

1. Clone the [saleor/apps](https://github.com/saleor/apps) repository.

:::info

If you want to fork [saleor/apps](https://github.com/saleor/apps), please read the [_Forking_](forking) article.

:::

2. Install the dependencies:

```bash
pnpm install
```

3. Set environment variables by making the copy the `.env.example` file to `.env`. More details about the variables can be found in the section [below](#environment-variables).

4. Start all the dev servers:

```bash
pnpm dev
```

You can also start an individual application with:

```bash
pnpm dev --filter=saleor-app-X
```

where X is the app's name (matching apps/X).

## Build

To build all apps, run:

```bash
pnpm build
```

### Environment variables

:::info

If you want to learn more about setting environment variables in Next.js, head over to the [documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/environment-variables).

:::

`SECRET_KEY` (_optional_)

A randomly generated key for the encryption of [Settings Manager](https://github.com/saleor/saleor-app-sdk/blob/main/docs/settings-manager.md).

Although it is not required in the development, we recommend to set it. If not set, a random key will be generated on each app start.

`APL` (_optional_)

Name of the chosen implementation of the [Authentication Persistence Layer](https://github.com/saleor/saleor-app-sdk/blob/main/docs/apl.md).

When no value is provided, `FileAPL` is used by default. See `saleor-app.ts` in the app directory to see supported APLs.

`APP_LOG_LEVEL` (_optional_)

The logging level is based on which the app will decide on what messages to log.

The possible values are: `trace`, `debug`, `info`, `warn`, `error`, `fatal`, and `silent`. The default value is `silent` which means no logs will be printed.

You can read more about our logger in [its documentation](https://getpino.io/#/docs/api?id=loggerlevel-string-gettersetter).

`ALLOWED_DOMAIN_PATTERN` (_optional_)

A regex pattern that prohibits the app from being installed on a Saleor instance that does not match the pattern. If not set, all installations will be allowed.
