:::caution
We are in the process of deprecating plugins in favor of [apps](developer/extending/apps/overview.mdx). If you plan on building a new integration with Saleor, we recommend using apps instead.

## Key concepts

Dummy Credit Card is a Saleor testing gateway. If you want to configure it, you can do it
through the dashboard (go to `settings/plugins` page and choose dummy from the plugins list).

## Testing for different responses

Below is the list of test card numbers that can be used for checking different responses. To check response with Saleor Storefront's use, enter one of the given card numbers, valid expiration date, and random CVV value.

Any other card numbers with valid expiration dates and random CVV values create a successful payment.

| Card number | Response                                                              |
| ----------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `0069`      | Causes `Card expired` error.                                          |
| `9995`      | Causes `Insufficient funds` error.                                    |
| `0127`      | Causes `Incorrect CVV` error.                                         |
| `0002`      | Causes `Card declined` error.                                         |
| `1111`      | The Card is pre-authorized and causes `Card declined` during capture. |
| `1112`      | The Card is pre-authorized and successfully capture.                  |

### Testing different responses with API

In the case of testing dummy payment responses with API, you need to have a checkout with shipping and billing address set. See [the checkout page](developer/checkout/overview.mdx)
to know how to create a checkout object.
Then create checkout payment with use of [`checkoutPaymentCreate`](api-reference/checkout/mutations/checkout-payment-create.mdx) mutation,
set card number as a `token` value and `mirumee.payments.dummy` as a `gateway`.
To check gateway response use `CheckoutComplete` mutation.
Let's see an example for a token that causes Card Expired error.

```graphql {2-9}
mutation {
  checkoutPaymentCreate(
    input: {
      amount: "15.00"
      gateway: "mirumee.payments.dummy"
      token: "4000000000000069"
    }
    token: "91e831f2-92c6-4977-aeca-3cc4c5292ead"
  ) {
    payment {
      id
      gateway
      token
    }
    errors {
      field
      message
    }
  }
}
```

We get newly created payment object:

```json
{
  "data": {
    "checkoutPaymentCreate": {
      "payment": {
        "id": "UGF5bWVudDoyMg==",
        "gateway": "mirumee.payments.dummy",
        "token": "4000000000000069",
        "creditCard": null,
        "__typename": "Payment"
      },
      "errors": [],
      "__typename": "CheckoutPaymentCreate"
    }
  }
}
```

Completing checkout and testing gateway response:

```graphql {2-4}
mutation {
  checkoutComplete(token: "91e831f2-92c6-4977-aeca-3cc4c5292ead") {
    errors {
      field
      message
      code
      __typename
    }
    order {
      id
      token
      __typename
    }
    __typename
  }
}
```

As a response, we get an error corresponding to the given card number:

```json {7-8}
{
  "data": {
    "checkoutComplete": {
      "checkoutErrors": [
        {
          "field": null,
          "message": "Card expired",
          "code": "PAYMENT_ERROR",
          "__typename": "CheckoutError"
        }
      ],
      "order": null,
      "__typename": "CheckoutComplete"
    }
  }
}
```
