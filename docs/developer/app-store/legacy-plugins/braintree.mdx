## Creating payment

The [`checkoutPaymentCreate`](/api-reference/checkout/mutations/checkout-payment-create.mdx) mutation takes the following arguments:

- `id`: the checkout id (if required by a payment gateway).
- `input`: [PaymentInput](api-reference/payments/inputs/payment-input.mdx) object:
- `gateway`: the ID of the selected payment gateway (a list of the available payment gateways can be fetched from the `Checkout.availablePaymentGateways` field). The selected gateway must support the checkout currency.
- `token`: a client-side generated payment token (if required).
- `amount`: the total amount of this operation.
- `returnUrl`: URL of a storefront view where the user should be redirected after requiring additional actions. Payment with additional actions will not be finished if this field is not provided.
- `storePaymentMethod`: the type of payment storage in a gateway. [StorePaymentMethod](api-reference/payments/enums/store-payment-method-enum.mdx) value. If not provided, defaults to `NONE`.
- `metadata`: a list of [MetadataInput](api-reference/miscellaneous/inputs/metadata-input.mdx).

This mutation returns the following fields:

- `checkout`: the updated checkout object.
- `payment`: the newly created payment object.
- `errors`: a list of errors that occurred during mutation execution.

```graphql {2-15}
mutation {
  checkoutPaymentCreate(
    id: "Q2hlY2tvdXQ6ZTEzZDFjOTItOWJkNi00ODViLTgyMDctZTNhM2I5NjVkZTQw"
    input: {
      gateway: "mirumee.payments.braintree"
      token: "tokencc_bh_s3bjkh_24smq8_6c6zhq_w4v6b9_8vz"
      amount: 25.99
      storePaymentMethod: ON_SESSION
      metadata: [{ key: "user_id", value: "#1234" }]
    }
  ) {
    payment {
      id
      chargeStatus
      metadata {
        key
        value
      }
    }
    paymentErrors {
      field
      message
    }
  }
}
```

As a result, we get the payment object:

```json
{
  "data": {
    "checkoutPaymentCreate": {
      "payment": {
        "id": "UGF5bWVudDox",
        "chargeStatus": "NOT_CHARGED",
        "metadata": [
          {
            "key": "user_id",
            "value": "#1234"
          }
        ]
      },
      "errors": []
    }
  }
}
```

Afterward we can call [`checkoutComplete`](/api-reference/checkout/mutations/checkout-complete.mdx) mutation to finalize checkout.
