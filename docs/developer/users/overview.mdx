Saleor distinguishes between two main types of users: **Customers** and **Staff Users**. 
Understanding these roles is key to managing access, responsibilities, and security in your store.

## Customers
Customers are people who use your storefront to purchase. They create their own accounts and interact with your products and services. 

:::note
If a staff user places an order, they will also appear in the customers list.

## Staff Users
Staff Users are internal team members who manage your store, such as administrators, content editors, fulfillment staff, or support agents. 
Staff accounts have elevated access and can be assigned specific permissions.

## Permissions and Groups
Staff permissions control what actions users can perform and what data they can access. 
Permissions are assigned through groups, making it easy to manage roles for multiple users at once. 
For details, see the [Permissions](/developer/permissions.mdx) guide.
