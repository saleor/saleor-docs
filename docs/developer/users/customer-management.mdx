title: Customers
---

Saleor enables staff users and authorized apps to manage customer accounts and data. 
While customers can register and manage their own accounts, there are many scenarios where staff 
or third-party apps need to interact with customer data directly for support, marketing, analytics, or system integration.

Managing customer data is essential for:
- **Support:** Update customer details, reset passwords, or deactivate accounts on request.
- **Data Quality:** Correct errors, merge duplicates, or enrich customer profiles.
- **Compliance:** Remove or anonymize data for privacy regulations.
- **Integrations:** Sync customer data with external systems via apps or automation.

## Permissions
Managing customers is available to users and apps with the `MANAGE_USERS` permission.

## Creating a Customer
You can create customer accounts using either the Saleor Dashboard (admin UI) or the API:

- **Dashboard:** Staff users can manually create customer accounts through the **Customers** section in the Dashboard.
- **API:** Staff users or apps can create customer accounts programmatically using the [`customerCreate`](/api-reference/users/mutations/customer-create.mdx) mutation.

Unlike the `accountRegister` mutation, where a password must be set immediately, when a customer account is created by staff or an app, 
there is no immediate need to set a password. Instead, a link for setting the password will be automatically emailed to the customer. 
This provides a convenient way to onboard customers.

:::info
A set password email will be sent only if both `redirectUrl` and `channel` are provided in the `customerCreate` mutation.

## Updating Customer Data
If your storefront does not expose profile editing, customer data such as name or email can be updated through the API by staff users or app.
You can update or manage customer data using either the Dashboard or the API:

- **Dashboard:** Staff users can edit customer details (name, email, addresses, etc.) directly in the **Customers** section. This is ideal for manual corrections or support requests.
- **API:** Staff users or apps can update customer data programmatically using the [`customerUpdate`](/api-reference/users/mutations/customer-update.mdx) mutation. This is useful for automated processes, syncing with external systems, or bulk updates.

## Delete a Customer
- **Dashboard:** Staff users can remove customer directly in the **Customers** section.
- **API:** Use the [`customerDelete`](/api-reference/users/mutations/customer-delete.mdx) mutation.

## Migrating Customers to Saleor
You can migrate customers from an existing system to Saleor using an Identity Provider (IdP) with the OpenID Connect (OIDC) plugin. 
With OIDC integration configured, customer accounts are automatically created in Saleor the first time users log in via your IdP. 
The OIDC plugin stores the IdP's authorization key in the customer's private metadata.

### Implementation Steps
1. **Configure OIDC Plugin:**
   - Go to Extensions → Add Extension → Explore
   - Find OpenID Connect (OIDC) and click Install
   - Configure your IdP settings (Client ID/Secret, Authorization/Token URLs, JSON Web Key Set URL, User Info URL)
   - For detailed steps, see [OIDC Plugin documentation](/developer/app-store/plugins/oidc.mdx)
2. **Set Up Authentication Flow:**
   - Configure your frontend to use the IdP for authentication.
   - When users log in, Saleor will:
     - Create a new customer account if one doesn't exist.
     - Store the IdP's authorization key in user private metadata.
   - For implementation details, see [Authentication using OpenID Connect](/api-usage/authentication.mdx#user-authentication-using-openid-connect).

:::info
All anonymous orders placed using a given email address will be automatically linked to the corresponding customer account after the user logs in via the configured Identity Provider (IdP).

## Extending Customers with Metadata

Saleor allows you to attach custom metadata to customer accounts, enabling integrations with external systems or adding custom fields.

You can manage customer metadata using either the Dashboard or the API:

- **Dashboard:**  
  Staff users can view, add, or edit customer metadata directly in the **Customers** section of the Dashboard, within the customer details view.

- **API:**  
  - To set or update metadata when updating a customer, include the `metadata` or `privateMetadata` fields in the [`customerUpdate`](/api-reference/users/mutations/customer-update.mdx) mutation.
  - For more granular control, use the dedicated metadata mutations:
    - [`updateMetadata`](/api-reference/miscellaneous/mutations/update-metadata.mdx) for public key-value data (visible to apps and staff).
    - [`updatePrivateMetadata`](/api-reference/miscellaneous/mutations/update-private-metadata.mdx) for secure/internal values (not exposed via the public API).


## Exporting Customer Data
Saleor does not provide CSV exports by default. You must implement this yourself.

To export customer data (e.g., for analytics or GDPR):
- Use the [`customers`](/api-reference/users/queries/customers.mdx) query to fetch customers.
- Include fields like name, email, and metadata.
- Automate extraction with scripts calling Saleor’s GraphQL API.
