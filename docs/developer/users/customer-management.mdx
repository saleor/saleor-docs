title: Customer Management
---

Saleor enables staff users and authorized apps to manage customer accounts and data. 
While customers can register and manage their own accounts, there are many scenarios where staff 
or third-party apps need to interact with customer data directly for support, marketing, analytics, or system integration.

Managing customer data is essential for:
- **Support:** Update customer details, reset passwords, or deactivate accounts on request.
- **Data Quality:** Correct errors, merge duplicates, or enrich customer profiles.
- **Compliance:** Remove or anonymize data for privacy regulations.
- **Integrations:** Sync customer data with external systems via apps or automation.

## Permissions
Managing customers is available to users and apps with the `MANAGE_USERS` permission.

## Creating a Customer
You can create customer accounts using either the Saleor Dashboard (admin UI) or the API:

- **Dashboard:** Staff users can manually create customer accounts through the **Customers** section in the Dashboard.
- **API:** Staff users or apps can create customer accounts programmatically using the [`customerCreate`](/api-reference/users/mutations/customer-create.mdx) mutation.

Unlike the `accountRegister` mutation, where a password must be set immediately, when a customer account is created by staff or an app, 
there is no immediate need to set a password. Instead, a link for setting the password will be automatically emailed to the customer. 
This provides a convenient way to onboard customers.

:::info
A set password email is sent only if both `redirectUrl` and `channel` are provided in the `customerCreate` mutation and the relevant plugin or app is subscribed to the correct event.

## Updating Customer Data
If your storefront does not expose profile editing, staff users or apps can update customer data through the Dashboard or the API:

- **Dashboard:** Edit customer details (name, email, addresses, etc.) directly in the `Customers` section.
- **API:** Use the [`customerUpdate`](/api-reference/users/mutations/customer-update.mdx) mutation to update details programmatically.

## Delete a Customer
- **Dashboard:** Staff users can remove customer directly in the **Customers** section.
- **API:** Use the [`customerDelete`](/api-reference/users/mutations/customer-delete.mdx) mutation.

Deleting a customer does **not** remove their orders or related records. 
Order history and associated data remain in the system even after the customer account is deleted.

## Migrating Customers to Saleor

If you are migrating an existing store to Saleor and need to import your existing customers:

### Create Customers via API
For each customer, run the [`customerCreate`](/api-reference/users/mutations/customer-create.mdx) mutation.
You can't directly transfer password hashes, you need to allow customers to set their passwords. 
To send password-setup emails, include both the `redirectUrl` and `channel` parameters in the mutation.
Ensure that the relevant plugin or app for sending customer emails is enabled.

### Using Identity Provider

If you use an identity provider (IdP) for login, customer accounts will be automatically created
 or linked in Saleor the first time users sign in via the configured IdP.
The OIDC plugin stores the IdP’s authorization key in the customer’s private metadata.


Learn how to set up the OIDC plugin in the [OIDC guide](/api-usage/authentication.mdx#user-authentication-using-openid-connect).

All anonymous orders placed using a given email address will be automatically linked to the corresponding customer account after the user logs in.

## Extending Customers with Metadata

Saleor allows you to attach custom metadata to customer accounts, enabling integrations with external systems or adding custom fields.

You can manage customer metadata using either the Dashboard or the API:

- **Dashboard:**  
  Staff users can view, add, or edit customer metadata directly in the **Customers** section of the Dashboard, within the customer details view.

- **API:**  
  - To set or update metadata when updating a customer, include the `metadata` or `privateMetadata` fields in the [`customerUpdate`](/api-reference/users/mutations/customer-update.mdx) mutation.
  - For more granular control, use the dedicated metadata mutations:
    - [`updateMetadata`](/api-reference/miscellaneous/mutations/update-metadata.mdx) for public key-value data (visible to apps and staff).
    - [`updatePrivateMetadata`](/api-reference/miscellaneous/mutations/update-private-metadata.mdx) for secure/internal values (not exposed via the public API).


## Exporting Customer Data
Saleor does not provide CSV exports by default. You must implement this yourself.

To export customer data (e.g., for analytics or GDPR):
- Use the [`customers`](/api-reference/users/queries/customers.mdx) query to fetch customers.
- Include fields like name, email, and metadata.
- Automate extraction with scripts calling Saleor’s GraphQL API.
