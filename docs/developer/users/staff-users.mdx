title: Staff Users
---

Staff users are internal team members who manage your Saleor store. 
You can assign staff users specific permissions to control what they can access and do in the Dashboard and API. 
Staff users are essential for store operations, including product management, order fulfillment, customer support, and more.

## Inviting Staff Users
You can invite staff users to your Saleor store using either the Dashboard or the API.

:::note
You need the `MANAGE_STAFF` permission to invite staff members.
:::

### Dashboard
1. Go to **Configuration → Staff Members**.
2. Click **Invite staff member**.
3. Enter the staff member’s first name, last name, and email address.
4. Click **Send Invite**.

Saleor will send an email invitation to the provided address. The recipient can set their password and log in using a secure link.

After inviting a staff user, you can assign them to a permission group. 
For details on permission groups, scopes, and channel restrictions, see the [Permissions documentation](/developer/permissions.mdx).


### API
You can also create staff users programmatically using the [`staffCreate`](../../api-reference/users/mutations/staff-create.mdx) mutation 
This allows you to assign permissions and add metadata in the same step.

```graphql
mutation StaffCreate($input: StaffCreateInput!) {
  staffCreate(input: $input) {
    user {
      id
      email
    }
    errors {
      field
      message
    }
  }
}
```

Variables:

```json
{
  "input": {
    "email": "team.member@example.com",
    "firstName": "Team",
    "lastName": "Member",
    "addGroups": [
      "R3JvdXA6MQ=="
    ]
  }
}
```
## Updating Staff Data
You can update staff user details using the Dashboard or the [`staffUpdate`](../../api-reference/users/mutations/staff-update.mdx) mutation.

## Removing Staff Users
You can remove staff users using the Dashboard or the API:
- **Dashboard:** Remove staff users from the **Staff Members** section.
- **API:** Use the [`staffDelete`](../../api-reference/users/mutations/staff-delete.mdx) or [`staffBulkDelete`](../../api-reference/users/mutations/staff-bulk-delete.mdx) mutations.

Saleor prevent removing or deactivating the last active staff user who can manage specific permissions.

:::info
If a staff user has placed orders, their customer record will remain for order history and reporting. 
Removing a staff user does not delete their customer data.
:::

## Extending Staff Users with Metadata
You can attach custom metadata to staff user accounts for integrations or custom fields.

- To set or update metadata when updating a user, include the `metadata` or `privateMetadata` fields in the [`staffUpdate`](../../api-reference/users/mutations/staff-update.mdx) mutation.
- For more granular control, use:
  - [`updateMetadata`](../../api-reference/miscellaneous/mutations/update-metadata.mdx) for public key-value data (visible to apps and staff).
  - [`updatePrivateMetadata`](../../api-reference/miscellaneous/mutations/update-private-metadata.mdx) for secure/internal values (not exposed via the public API).

## Dashboard Features for Staff Users
Saleor provides advanced dashboard features to help staff users personalize their workspace and work efficiently.

### Saving Filter Presets
You can save filter presets on list views for quick access to frequently used filters (e.g., “Out of Stock Products”, “High-Value Orders”).

**To save a filter preset:**
1. Go to a list view (e.g., Products).
2. Apply filters (such as channel or search terms).
3. Click the **+** icon next to the list title.
4. Enter a name for your preset and click **Save**.

:::note
Filter presets are saved in your browser’s local storage, meaning they are only available on the device and browser where they were created. 
They will not sync across devices or browsers.
:::

### Product Grid Customization
You can customize which columns are visible in list views. 
Rearrange columns by dragging and dropping, or toggle columns on and off. Grid customization is saved per user.

:::note
Your column preferences are stored in your user metadata, making them available across different browsers and devices when you're logged into your staff account.
:::

You can enable preview features from your account settings.

**To access feature previews:**
1. In the left navigation menu, click the **⋮** (three dots) next to your name.
2. Click **Features Preview**.
3. Enable or disable available preview features as needed. 

:::note
Feature preview preferences are stored in your user metadata, so they persist across devices and sessions.
