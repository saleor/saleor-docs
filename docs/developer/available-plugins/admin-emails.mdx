`AdminEmails` plugin handles email communication with staff (Dashboard users).

Internally, the plugin is similar to [`UserEmails`](developer/available-plugins/user-emails.mdx), with a few notable differences:

- Available events
- Self-hosted: SMTP configuration can be set up as [environment variables](developer/running-saleor/configuration.mdx)
- Saleor Cloud: Sending emails is handled by Cloud's SMTP server by default.
