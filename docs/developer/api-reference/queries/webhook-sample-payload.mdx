Retrieve a sample payload for a given webhook event based on real data. It can be useful for some integrations where sample payload is required.

```graphql
webhookSamplePayload(
  eventType: WebhookSampleEventTypeEnum!
): JSONString

```

### Arguments

#### `eventType` ([`WebhookSampleEventTypeEnum!`](../../../developer/api-reference/enums/webhook-sample-event-type-enum))

Name of the requested event type.

### Type

#### [`JSONString`](../../../developer/api-reference/scalars/json-string)

Allows use of a JSON String for input / output from the GraphQL schema.

Use of this type is _not recommended_ as you lose the benefits of having a defined, static
schema (one of the key benefits of GraphQL).
