Determine a current authorize status for order.

    We treat the order as fully authorized when the sum of authorized and charged funds
    cover the order.total.
    We treat the order as partially authorized when the sum of authorized and charged
    funds covers only part of the order.total
    We treat the order as not authorized when the sum of authorized and charged funds is
    0.

    NONE - the funds are not authorized
    PARTIAL - the funds that are authorized or charged don't cover fully the order's
    total
    FULL - the funds that are authorized or charged fully cover the order's total

```graphql
enum OrderAuthorizeStatusEnum {
  NONE
  PARTIAL
