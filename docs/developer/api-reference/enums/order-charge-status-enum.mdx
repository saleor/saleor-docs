title: OrderChargeStatusEnum
---

Determine the current charge status for the order.

    We treat the order as overcharged when the charged amount is bigger that order.total
    We treat the order as fully charged when the charged amount is equal to order.total.
    We treat the order as partially charged when the charged amount covers only part of
    the order.total

    NONE - the funds are not charged.
    PARTIAL - the funds that are charged don't cover the order's total
    FULL - the funds that are charged fully cover the order's total
    OVERCHARGED - the charged funds are bigger than order's total

```graphql
enum OrderChargeStatusEnum {
  NONE
  PARTIAL
  FULL
  OVERCHARGED
}
```
