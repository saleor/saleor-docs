title: Exporting Products
---

## Introduction

This guide describes how to export products from the Saleor GraphQL API.
Exporting products can be useful for creating backups of your data or for easy
and quick bulk editing.

You can export all products, filtered products, or products with specific IDs.
Products data can be exported to CSV or XLSX file, but CSV file is recommended because
it is much less time-consuming to generate. You can also define which fields will be exported.
If any product variants fields are specified then products and variants data are exported.
Link to download file is sent by email to the requestor. If any error occurs then
email with information about problems is sent.

:::note
When the export is made by the `App` email is not sent. You can get the file by query the
`ExportFile` with ID returned from `exportProducts` mutation.

### Export File Structure

Each row in the exported file represents a single product variant, but it also contains
general product fields.
For example, if a product has three variants, there will be three lines in total.
Each line will contain common product fields such as name or description,
and fields specific to given variant:

| id  | name         | description                    | variant sku | variant weight |
| --- | ------------ | ------------------------------ | ----------- | -------------- |
| 61  | Orange Juice | No additives, no preservatives | 12345       | 500 g          |
| 61  | Orange Juice | No additives, no preservatives | 32145       | 1000 g         |
| 61  | Orange Juice | No additives, no preservatives | 45123       | 1500 g         |

The exact shape of the file depends on the fields selected for export
(see the `exportInfo` input fields). If no variant fields are provided,
each row will contain only product fields:

| id  | name         | description                    | category    | product weight |
| --- | ------------ | ------------------------------ | ----------- | -------------- |
| 61  | Orange Juice | No additives, no preservatives | juices      | 500 g          |
| 65  | Apple Juice  | No additives, great taste      | juices      | 1000 g         |
| 101 | Polo Shirt   | Nice and comfortable           | polo-shirts | 200 g          |

## Exporting Products

:::note
Products can be exported only by logged users with `MANAGE_PRODUCTS` permission.
:::

To export products, use `exportProducts` mutation.

This mutation takes the following input:

- `scope`: determine which products should be exported. You can choose between exporting
  all products (`ALL`), filtered products (`FILTER`) or selected IDs (`IDS`).
  You can find more details in the next sections.
- `filter`: defines filtering option. This field is optional but must be specified if your
  choose `FILTER` scope option.
- `ids`: a list of products IDs to export. This field is optional but must be specified
  if `IDS` in `scope` is chosen.
- `fileType`: defines exported file type. You can choose between `CSV` and `XLSX` file.
- `exportInfo`: determine exported fields. It takes the following input:
  - `attributes`: list of attribute IDs to export (optional).
  - `warehouses`: list of warehouse IDs to export (optional).
  - `fields`: list of product and variants fields to export
    (optional, `ID` field is exported by default).

As a result, this mutation returns `ExportFile` object which is a `Job` instance.
For details look at [export mutations descriptions](export-overview#mutations).

### Selecting Fields to Include

The following example shows how to export all products with all available fields
to CSV file.

The order of fields that you pass defines the order of headers in the exported file.
Exporting any of `price` fields adds a `currency` field by default.

```graphql {7-22}
mutation {
  exportProducts(
    input: {
      scope: ALL
      fileType: CSV
      exportInfo: {
        fields: [
          NAME
          DESCRIPTION
          PRODUCT_TYPE
          CATEGORY
          VISIBLE
          COLLECTIONS
          CHARGE_TAXES
          PRODUCT_IMAGES
          VARIANT_SKU
          VARIANT_PRICE
          COST_PRICE
          VARIANT_IMAGES
          PRODUCT_WEIGHT
          VARIANT_WEIGHT
        ]
      }
    }
  ) {
    exportFile {
      id
      status
      createdAt
      updatedAt
      url
    }
    errors {
      field
      code
      message
    }
  }
}
```

In response we get workers information:

```json
{
  "data": {
    "exportProducts": {
      "exportFile": {
        "id": "RXhwb3J0RmlsZToxMA==",
        "status": "PENDING",
        "createdAt": "2020-06-05T09:15:42.924676+00:00",
        "updatedAt": "2020-06-05T09:16:27.691838+00:00",
        "url": ""
      },
      "errors": []
    }
  }
}
```

Once the task is finished, the `url` field will contain the URL address of the
exported file. If export was triggered by `User` the link to the file will be sent by email
to the requestor.
To check if URL is ready you can just fetch [ExportFile](export-overview#fetching-exportfile-instance).

### Applying Filters

To export only filtered products you need to set the `scope` to `FILTER` and include the `filter`
paramter.

The following example will only export published products from two specific categories:

```graphql {4,7-10}
mutation {
  exportProducts(
    input: {
      scope: FILTER
      fileType: CSV
      exportInfo: { fields: [NAME, DESCRIPTION, PRODUCT_TYPE, VARIANT_SKU] }
      filter: {
        isPublished: true
        categories: ["Q2F0ZWdvcnk6Nw==", "Q2F0ZWdvcnk6MjI="]
      }
    }
  ) {
    exportFile {
      id
      status
      createdAt
      updatedAt
      url
    }
    errors {
      field
      code
      message
    }
  }
}
```

### Exporting Products With Specified IDs

To export only products with provided ids you need to set the `scope` to `IDS` and include the `ids`
parameter.

```graphql {4,7}
mutation {
  exportProducts(
    input: {
      scope: IDS
      fileType: CSV
      exportInfo: { fields: [NAME, DESCRIPTION, PRODUCT_TYPE, VARIANT_SKU] }
      ids: ["UHJvZHVjdDo3Mg==", "UHJvZHVjdDo4Nw==", "UHJvZHVjdDoxMTU="]
    }
  ) {
    exportFile {
      id
      status
      createdAt
      updatedAt
      url
    }
    errors {
      field
      code
      message
    }
  }
}
```

### Selecting Warehouses and Attributes

To export data about specified warehouses and attributes you need to provide list of
warehouses or attributes IDs.

If you specify warehouses, then for all variants with stocks in given warehouse,
data about stock quantity will be exported. It will be visible in column:
`warehouse-slug (warehouse quantity)`.

If you specify attributes, then data about given attribute value for all
products and variants will be exported (empty if not exists).
Attributes value will be visible in column:
`attribute-slug (product attribute)` for product attributes and
`attribute-slug (product attribute)` for variant attributes.

Below you can find example of exporting warehouses and
attributes data.

```graphql {8-12}
mutation {
  exportProducts(
    input: {
      scope: ALL
      fileType: CSV
      exportInfo: {
        fields: [NAME, VARIANT_SKU]
        warehouses: [
          "V2FyZWhvdXNlOjA1ZmFmZjRmLTViYWItNDIzNC04MTBhLTM5NjI5MDMyMWFkMg=="
          "V2FyZWhvdXNlOjQ3Mjc3NjM2LTQ1MWItNGNmZi04OWJkLWM5MTA4OWNiNTdkYQ=="
        ]
        attributes: ["QXR0cmlidXRlOjE1", "QXR0cmlidXRlOjE4"]
      }
    }
  ) {
    exportFile {
      id
      status
      createdAt
      updatedAt
      url
    }
    errors {
      field
      code
      message
    }
  }
}
```
