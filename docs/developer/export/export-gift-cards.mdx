title: Exporting Gift cards
---

## Introduction
Exporting gift cards allow downloading list of gift cards' codes to CSV or XLSX file.
You can export all gift cards, filtered gift cards, or gift cards with specific IDs,
but only unused cards will be exported.
Link to download file is sent by email to the requestor. If any error occurs then
email with information about problems is sent.

### Export file structure
The exported file contains one column with `code` header in the first row
and gift cards codes in the following rows, like it's showed below.

| code           |
|----------------|
| ABCD-EFGH-IJKL |
| IJKL-ABCD-EFGH |
| EFGH-ABCD-IJKL |
| IJKL-EFGH-ABCD |

## Exporting gift cards
:::note
Gift cards can be exported only by logged users with `MANAGE_GIFT_CARD` permission.
Only unused gift cards' codes are exported.
:::

To export gift cards, use `exportGiftCards` mutation.

This mutation takes the following input:
- `scope`: determine which gift cards should be exported. You can choose between exporting
all unused gift cards (`ALL`), filtered gift cards (`FILTER`) or selected IDs (`IDS`).
You can find more details in the next sections.
- `filter`: defines filtering option. This field is optional but must be specified if your
choose `FILTER` scope option.
- `ids`: a list of products IDs to export. This field is optional but must be specified
if `IDS` in `scope` is chosen.
- `fileType`: defines exported file type. You can choose between `CSV` and `XLSX` file.

As a result, this mutation returns `ExportFile` object which is a `Job` instance.
For details look at [export mutations descriptions](export-overview#mutations).

### Exporting all gift cards
The following example shows how to export all gift cards with all available fields
to CSV file. (For exporting to XLSX just replace `CSV` with `XLSX` in `fileType` field.)

```graphql {2-6}
mutation {
  exportGiftCards(
    input: {
        scope: ALL,
        fileType: CSV,
    }
 ){
    exportFile {
      id
      status
      createdAt
      updatedAt
      url
    }
    errors {
      field
      code
      message
    }
  }
}
```

In response we get workers information:
```json
{
  "data": {
    "exportGiftCards": {
      "exportFile": {
        "id": "RXhwb3J0RmlsZTox",
        "status": "PENDING",
        "createdAt": "2020-06-05T09:15:42.924676+00:00",
        "updatedAt": "2020-06-05T09:16:27.691838+00:00",
        "url": ""
      },
      "errors": []
    }
  }
}
```

Once the task is finished, the `url` field will contain the URL address of the
exported file. If export was triggered by `User` the link to the file will be sent by email
to the requestor.
To check if URL is ready you can just fetch [ExportFile](export-overview#fetching-exportfile-instance).

### Exporting filtered gift cards
To export only filtered gift cards you need to define `FILTER` `scope` and `filter`
field. Lets see an example for exporting only gift cards with `birthday` tag value.

```graphql {2-9}
mutation {
  exportGiftCards(
    input: {
        scope: FILTER,
        fileType: XLSX,
        filter: {
            tags: ["birthday"],
        }
    }
 ){
    exportFile {
      id
      status
      createdAt
      updatedAt
      url
    }
    errors {
      field
      code
      message
    }
  }
}
```

### Exporting gift cards with specified IDs
To export only gift cards with provided ids you need to define `IDS` `scope` and `ids`
field. Lets see an example:
```graphql {2-9}
mutation {
  exportGiftCards(
    input: {
        scope: IDS,
        fileType: CSV,
        ids: [
          "R2lmdENhcmQ6MjU=", "R2lmdENhcmQ6MjY=", "R2lmdENhcmQ6Mjc="
        ]
    }
 ){
    exportFile {
      id
      status
      createdAt
      updatedAt
      url
    }
    errors {
      field
      code
      message
    }
  }
}
```
