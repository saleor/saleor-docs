## Third-party Apps
### Installing an App

Installing an App with `appInstall` mutation creates an App based on its manifest URL. 

This mutation is only available to staff users with the `MANAGE_APPS` permission. Staff user can't grant app more permissions than he has for his own.

The mutation takes the following input fields:
- `appName`: the name of the App, required.
- `manifestUrl`: URL of the manifest file, required.
- `permissions`: list of permissions the app should be granted.
- `activateAfterInstallation`: immediately activate the new App. Default true.

The response of the mutation contains the `appInstallation` which contains all information about installation process.

```graphql {2-8}
mutation{
  appInstall(
      input: {
        appName: "External Order App", 
        manifestUrl: "http://localhost:3000/manifest", 
        permissions:[MANAGE_ORDERS]
      }
  ) {
    appInstallation{
      id
      status
      appName
      manifestUrl
    }
    appErrors{
      field
      message
      code
      permissions
    }
  }
}
```
If there are no errors in the response, a new app installation process is created:

```json
{
  "data": {
    "appInstall": {
      "appInstallation": {
        "id": "QXBwT25nb2luZ0luc3RhbGxhdGlvbjoz",
        "status": "PENDING",
        "appName": "Order App",
        "manifestUrl": "http://localhost:3000/manifest"
      },
      "appErrors": []
    }
  }
}
```

The chart below explains workflow of the installation process:

`}
/>

### Retrieving ongoing installations

To fetch all ongoing and failed installations, use the `appsInstallations` query. 
This query is only available to staff users with the `MANAGE_APPS` permission. 
The query returns list of `AppInstallation` objects.

```graphql {2}
{
  appsInstallations{
    id
    status
    appName
  }
}
```
The query returns a similar response:
```json
{
  "data": {
    "appsInstallations": [
      {
        "id": "QXBwT25nb2luZ0luc3RhbGxhdGlvbjoy",
        "status": "FAILED",
        "appName": "Shipping App"
      },
      {
        "id": "QXBwT25nb2luZ0luc3RhbGxhdGlvbjoz",
        "status": "PENDING",
        "appName": "Order App"
      }
    ]
  }
}
```
### Retrying failed installation

If the `appsInstallations` query returns App with failed status, there is a possibility to retry the installation process. 
This mutation is only available to staff users with the `MANAGE_APPS` permission. 
Staff user can't retry app installation if app requires more permissions than he has for his own.
The `appRetryInstall` mutation will run the installation process for a given app.

The mutation takes the following fields:
- `id`: the id of the `AppInstallation`, required.
- `activateAfterInstallation`: immediately activate the new App. Default true.

Example of retrying installation of app with id `QXBwT25nb2luZ0luc3RhbGxhdGlvbjoy`:
```graphql {2}
 mutation{
  appRetryInstall(id:"QXBwT25nb2luZ0luc3RhbGxhdGlvbjoy"){
    appErrors{
      field
      message
      code
    }
    appInstallation{
      id
      status
    }
  }
}
```

### Deleting failed installation
If the `appsInstallations` query returns App with failed status, there is a possibility to delete failed installation. 
This mutation is only available to staff users with the `MANAGE_APPS` permission.
The `appDeleteFailedInstallation` mutation will delete failed installation.

The mutation takes the following fields:
- `id`: the id of the `AppInstallation`, required.

### Creating an App

To create a new app, use the `appCreate` mutation. This mutation is only available to staff users with the `MANAGE_APPS` permission. Staff user can't grant app more permissions than he has for his own. The mutation takes the following input fields:

- `name`: the name of the app.
- `isActive`: whether to activate the app, defaults to `true`.
- `permissions`: list of permissions the app should be granted.

Let's assume that we want to create an order processing service that can fetch and manage orders in Saleor. To do so, we create a new app with the `MANAGE_ORDERS` permission:

```graphql {2-4}
mutation {
  appCreate(
    input: { name: "Order processing service", permissions: [MANAGE_ORDERS] }
  ) {
    authToken
    app {
      id
      name
    }
    appErrors {
      field
      code
    }
  }
}
```

If there are no errors in the response, a new app is created:

```json
{
  "data": {
    "appCreate": {
      "authToken": "Es1O0oB2O3PTeG9A4IVYUcaMoru3Ls",
      "app": {
        "id": "QXBwOjk=",
        "name": "Order processing service"
      },
      "appErrors": []
    }
  }
}
```

The response contains the `authToken` field - this is the token that the app needs to include in requests to Saleor API to authorize itself and have access to queries or mutations that it needs.

:::note
The `authToken` field is only available in the mutation response and cannot be fetched later, except for the last four digits.
:::

### Creating authorization keys

Creating an app with `appCreate` mutation creates the default authorization token (`authToken`). You can create more authorization keys with the `appTokenCreate`. The mutation takes the following fields:

- `app`: ID of the app.
- `name`: (optional) name of the key.

```graphql {2}
mutation {
  appTokenCreate(input: { app: "QXBwOjk=" }) {
    authToken
    appErrors {
      field
      code
    }
    appToken {
      id
    }
  }
}
```

### Revoking authorization keys

To revoke an authorization key, use the `appTokenDelete`:

```graphql {2}
mutation {
  appTokenDelete(id: "QXBwOjk=") {
    appErrors {
      field
      code
  }
}
```

## Retrieving all Apps

To fetch list of all apps, use `apps` query. This query is only available to staff users with the `MANAGE_APPS` permission.

```graphql {2}
{
  apps(first: 5){
    edges{
      node{
        id
        permissions{
          code
        }
        name
        isActive
        webhooks{
          name
        }
        
      }
    }
  }
}
```


The query returns a similar response:
```json
{
  "data": {
    "apps": {
      "edges": [
        {
          "node": {
            "id": "QXBwOjE=",
            "permissions": [
              {
                "code": "MANAGE_ORDERS"
              }
            ],
            "name": "Order App",
            "isActive": true,
            "webhooks": []
          }
        }
      ]
    }
  }
}
```


## Activating an App
To activate an app, use the `appActivate` mutation. This mutation is only available to staff users with the `MANAGE_APPS` permission. 
Staff user can't activate app which has more permissions than he has for his own. 

The mutation takes the following fields:
- `id`: the id of the `App`, required.

```graphql {2}
mutation {
  appActivate(id:"QXBwOjE="){
    app{
      id
      isActive
    }
    appErrors{
      field
      message
      code
    }
  }
}
```

The query returns a similar response:
```json
{
  "data": {
    "appActivate": {
      "app": {
        "id": "QXBwOjE=",
        "isActive": true
      },
      "appErrors": []
    }
  }
}
```
## Deactivating an App

To deactivate an app, use the `appDeactivate` mutation. This mutation is only available to staff users with the `MANAGE_APPS` permission. 
Staff user can't deactivate an app which has more permissions than they have for their own. 

:::note
Deactivating an app will disable all auth-tokens generated for an app. 
The app won't receive a webhook payload.
:::

The mutation takes the following fields:
- `id`: the id of the `App`, required.

```graphql {2}
mutation {
  appDeactivate(id:"QXBwOjE="){
    app{
      id
      isActive
    }
    appErrors{
      field
      message
      code
    }
  }
}
```


The query returns a similar response:
```json
{
  "data": {
    "appDeactivate": {
      "app": {
        "id": "QXBwOjE=",
        "isActive": false
      },
      "appErrors": []
    }
  }
}
```

## Subscribing to a webhook

To subscribe to a webhook, we need to first create an app with proper permissions. Let's assume that we want to extend the order processing app that we've created in the example above. The app should receive notifications whenever new orders are created in Saleor. To do so, we'll create a new webhook using the `webhookCreate` mutation. The mutation takes the following input:

- `name`: name of the webhook.
- `targetUrl`: URL of a service that will receive webhooks requests.
- `events`: list of the events to subscribe to.
- `app`: ID of the app to which the webhook belongs.
- `isActive`: whether to activate the webhook.

```graphql {2-10}
mutation {
  webhookCreate(
    input: {
      name: "New orders notification"
      targetUrl: "https://order-processing-service.example.com"
      events: [ORDER_CREATED]
      app: "QXBwOjk="
      isActive: true
      secretKey: "secret-key"
    }
  ) {
    webhook {
      id
    }
    webhookErrors {
      field
      code
    }
  }
}
```

If there are no errors in the response, the webhook is successfully created. From now on, whenever a new order is placed, payload with order data will be sent to your `targetUrl`.

## Updating a webhook

To update a webhook (e.g. to deactivate it or change the permissions), use the `webhookUpdate` mutation. The mutation takes similar input fields as the `webhookCreate` mutation. The example below shows how to deactive a webhook:

```graphql {2}
mutation {
  webhookUpdate(id: "V2ViaG9vazox", input: { isActive: false }) {
    webhook {
      isActive
    }
    webhookErrors {
      field
      code
    }
  }
}
```

## Removing a webhook

To fully remove a webhook, use the `webhookDelete` mutation:

```graphql {2}
mutation {
  webhookDelete(id: "V2ViaG9vazox") {
    webhookErrors {
      field
      code
    }
  }
}
```
