title: Extending Dashboard with Apps
---

## Key concepts

App extensions allow applications to alter the dashboard's interface by contributing custom buttons, menu items, screens, and modal overlays.
It's a convenient way to add new features and capabilities without maintaining a custom dashboard application fork.

All contributed views are embedded inside an `<iframe>` to protect against XSS attacks.

:::warning
Saleor Dashboard design assumes apps can never impersonate native Saleor UI. It's expected that Dashboard will render additional labels like "Apps: ..." to ensure a user is aware this content is external.
:::

## Relation to Saleor dashboard and custom Dashboard

While these API, just like any other Saleor APIs can be used using fully-custom Dashboard, the API is mainly designed to be consumed by the official Saleor Dashboard.

This document contains assumptions of how the UI can handle such APIs

## Manifest

A single App can provide multiple extensions. You can add each extension by specifying it in the App's manifest.
The example manifest below defines two extensions, one providing a custom product action that opens a modal overlay and the second one providing an alternative product creation page:

```json
{
  ...
  "extensions": [
      {
        "label": "Create with Sample app",
        "mount": "PRODUCT_DETAILS_MORE_ACTIONS",
        "target": "POPUP",
        "permissions": [
            "MANAGE_PRODUCTS"
        ],
        "url": "https://example.com/extension/"
      },
      {
        "label": "Create with App and redirect",
        "mount": "PRODUCT_OVERVIEW_CREATE",
        "target": "APP_PAGE",
        "permissions": [
            "MANAGE_PRODUCTS"
        ],
        "url": "/extension/redirect"
      }
    ]
}
```

- `label`: The name which will be displayed in the dashboard.
- `mount`: The place where the extension will be mounted.
- `target`: The method of presenting the interface (defaults to `POPUP`). See `target` section below
- `permissions`: An array of [permissions](developer/permissions.mdx#app-permissions) required for a user to access the extension.
- `url`: The URL of the view to display. You can skip the domain and protocol when `target` is set to `APP_PAGE`, or when your manifest defines an `appUrl`.
When `target` is set to `POPUP`, the `url` will be used to render an `<iframe>`.
- `options` depending on the target, additional properties to control the behavior.

## Target types

App extensions provide four different types of targets, that control the behavior and rendering in the Dashboard. If target is not set, `POPUP` will be used as a default.

### `POPUP` target

This target is meant to render an app iframe on the modal view. The provided `url` will be used to render app's page. This UI renders medium-sized frame

This target doesn't provide any `options`

### `APP_PAGE` target

The `APP_PAGE` target works as a redirection from the mount location to the `apps/` section in the Dashboard. This section renders the app in the biggest possible frame.

This target doesn't provide any `options`

### `NEW_TAB` target

The `NEW_TAB` target is meant to open the provided url in the new browser tab. This can be helpful, for example, to connect 3-rd party services with Dashboard.

There are following options available

```json
"options": {
  "newTabTarget": {
    "metod": "GET" // or "POST"
  }
}
```

If not provided, the default value `GET` will be used.

- `GET` will open the URL similar to user opening the link in the new tab. Dashboard will append query params: `saleorApiUrl` and context fields (see "Context" below)
- `POST` will open the URL using POST method. This is similar to submitting the HTML form by the user. The `body` will contain following fields:
- `saleorApiUrl` - the URL of the saleor (starting with https, ending with `/graphql/`)
- `appId` - ID of the app object
- `accessToken` - short-living token that is intersection of app and logged user permissions
- context fields — see below

:::warning
`accessToken` is short-living and can't be refreshed outside the Dashboard. You can likely communicate with Saleor during the request, but do not try to pass it to the frontend.

To ensure seamless and safe user interaction with the UI, use App Page
:::

### `WIDGET` target

The `WIDGET` target stands for statically mounted iframes in various places around the dashboard. It will mount the frame similar to `APP_PAGE` and `PUPUP`, but usually much smaller.

Similar to `NEW_TAB` there are options allowing to choose the request method

```json
"options": {
  "widgetTarget": {
    "metod": "GET" // or "POST"
  }
}
```
If not provided, `GET` is the default

- `GET` will open the URL similar to user opening the link in the new tab. Dashboard will append query params: `saleorApiUrl` and context fields (see "Context" below). Additional fields will be passed to the iframe, similar to APP_AGE and POPUP, to help it render the UI (theme, feature flags, etc.)
- `POST` will open the URL using POST method. This is similar to submitting the HTML form by the user. The `body` will contain the following fields:
- `saleorApiUrl` - the URL of the saleor (starting with https, ending with `/graphql/`)
- `appId` - ID of the app object
- `accessToken` - short-living token that is intersection of app and logged user permissions. This token will be refreshed by the Dashboard in the background.
- context fields — see below


## Context

## Possible mounting places

Saleor requires extensions to define a mounting place. The table below explains all mounting locations currently supported by Saleor.
