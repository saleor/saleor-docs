title: Extending Dashboard with Apps
---

## Key concepts

App extensions allow extending different dashboard views by mounting the extension app inside a popup or redirecting users to the main app's page.
The app is created as a secure iframe that protects against XSS attacks.
It provides a way for customizing and extending the dashboard while keeping the code separate.

## Manifest

Apps can have multiple extensions. The extension is added by specifying it in the app's manifest.
The below sample manifest defines two extensions that will be attached to the dashboard:

```json
{
  ...
  "extensions": [
      {
        "label": "Create with Sample app",
        "mount": "PRODUCT_DETAILS_MORE_ACTIONS",
        "target": "POPUP",
        "permissions": [
            "MANAGE_PRODUCTS"
        ],
        "url": "https://example.com/extension/"
      },
      {
        "label": "Create with App and redirect",
        "mount": "PRODUCT_OVERVIEW_CREATE",
        "target": "APP_PAGE",
        "permissions": [
            "MANAGE_PRODUCTS"
        ],
        "url": "/extension/redirect"
      }
    ],
}
```

- `label` - Name which will be displayed in the dashboard
- `mount` - Place, where extension will be mounted
- `target` - Way of opening an extension's url. Default to `POPUP`.
  `POPUP` will mount extension in an iframe view. `APP_PAGE` will redirect users to the dashboard's app page
- `url` - Extension url. Url can start with `/` when `target` is set to `APP_PAGE` or manifest has defined `appUrl`.
  When `target` is set to `POPUP`, `url` will be used to render an iframe
