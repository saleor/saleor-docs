title: How to allow App installation only for specific domains
---

## Problem

Your App must be available on the internet for installation, but you want to restrict the installation to specific domains, for example:
- Your company's domain
- Your customer's domain
- Your app is paid and you want to control who can install it
- You want to avoid mixing development/staging/production installations

## Key concepts

- Saleor allows communication from the app as long, as the app provides a valid token. The token is exchanged during the app installation. Each app is responsible for storing the token.
- Saleor will send webhooks to the app once installed, with permissions required for each webhook event.

In this article we will show you how to restrict the installation of your app to specific domains and it will not cover managing access *after* the installation.

## Using `@saleor/app-sdk` for javascript apps

Saleor official [SDK for apps](./developing-apps/app-sdk/overview) provides a built-in wrapper to handle the installation process.

```typescript
// pages/api/register.ts

import { createAppRegisterHandler } from "@saleor/app-sdk/handlers/next";

export default createAppRegisterHandler({
  // ...
  allowedSaleorUrls: ["https://your-saleor.saleor.cloud/graphql/", url => url === "https://your-client.saleor.cloud/graphql/"], // list of URLs or patterns
});

```

The `allowedSaleorUrls` parameter is an array of URLs or functions that will be used to validate the installation request.
In this example, *manifest* used for installation should point to `your-app.com/api/register` path from `tokenTargetUrl` field.

Under the hood app-sdk will validate incoming Saleor domain against the provided list of allowed domains.

Hint: Public [Saleor Apps](https://github.com/saleor/apps) use this mechanism to restrict installations to the Saleor Cloud domain. They use the following pattern:

```dotenv
ALLOWED_DOMAIN_PATTERN=https://.*\.saleor\.cloud

```

And then use it in the app registration handler:

```typescript
        allowedSaleorUrls: [
          (url) => {
            if (process.env.ALLOWED_DOMAIN_PATTERN) {
              const regex = new RegExp(process.env.ALLOWED_DOMAIN_PATTERN);

              return regex.test(url);
            }

            return true;
          },
        ]
```

This pattern allows to control the installation allow-list from the environment variables, without deployment needed.

## Technology-agnostic approach

While the above example shows how to restrict installations in JavaScript/TypeScript, using the SDK, the same can be achieved in any technology stack.

Saleor will send a `POST` request to the `tokenTargetUrl` with the following header:

```
"saleor-api-url": "https://your-saleor.saleor.cloud/graphql/"
```

In your registration handler, you can validate the incoming request and Saleor domain against your allow-list.
