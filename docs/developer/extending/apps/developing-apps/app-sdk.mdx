App SDK

`@saleor/app-sdk` is an NPM library that should be a part of every Saleor App.

You can find SDK in:

- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@saleor/app-sdk)
- [GitHub](https://github.com/saleor/saleor-app-sdk)

# Installation

```shell
# Preferred - with pnpm
pnpm add @saleor/app-sdk

# With npm and yarn
npm i @saleor/app-sdk
yarn add @saleor/app-sdk
```

# Why SDK - philosophy

We believe developers should have the freedom to write apps in their style and technology. On the other hand, we want to hide as much boilerplate as possible.
That's why we introduced `@saleor/app-sdk` - to allow developers to focus on their business logic while app-sdk is responsible for Saleor implementation details.

# Versioning

app-sdk uses semver. [Releases and changelogs are tracked in GitHub](https://github.com/saleor/saleor-app-sdk/releases).

Currently, SDK is in pre-1.0 phase, meaning API is unstable, but we do our best to minimize breaking changes.

# Technology

SDK supports the JS ecosystem. It's Typescript-first. There are helpers related to React and Next.js, but we will introduce more frameworks in the future.

# API & docs

Docs are maintained [in the repository](https://github.com/saleor/saleor-app-sdk/tree/main/docs).
