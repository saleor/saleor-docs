# Issues

## I see Typescript errors

Saleor [Apps](https://github.com/saleor/apps), [SDK](https://github.com/saleor/saleor-app-sdk) and [App Template](https://github.com/saleor/saleor-app-template/discussions)
use [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/) package manager. It can be sensitive to dependencies resolutions, especially in a monorepo setup.

Please ensure you have installed the right version of pnpm on your machine and re-install dependencies with `pnpm install`.

To find the accurate pnpm version in your project, check the root `package.json` file and look for the `packageManager` field.

For example: `"packageManager": "pnpm@8.2.0"` means that you need to install exactly the `8.2.0` version of pnpm.

## Client-side GraphQL requests are rejected due to CORS error

If you are using the Saleor Cloud instance, you may encounter the following error when trying to make a GraphQL request from the client side:

```
Access to fetch at 'https://xxx.eu.saleor.cloud/' from origin 'https://your-application' has been blocked by CORS policy: Response to preflight request doesn't pass access control check: No 'Access-Control-Allow-Origin' header is present on the requested resource. If an opaque response serves your needs, set the request's mode to 'no-cors' to fetch the resource with CORS disabled.
```

The issue might be caused by the CORS policy set up in the Saleor Cloud dashboard. Navigate to the environment details of your instance and check the `Allowed API origins` section. If option `Selected origins` is selected, you have two possible solutions:

- Add your application URL to the list of allowed origins.
- Ensure your application makes GraphQL requests from the server side only.
