use [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/) package manager. It can be sensitive with dependencies resolutions, especially in a monorepo setup.

Please ensure you have installed right version of pnpm on your machine and re-install dependencies with `pnpm install`.

To find accurate pnpm version in your project, check root `package.json` file and find `packageManager` field.

For example `"packageManager": "pnpm@8.2.0"` means that you need to install exactly `8.2.0` version of pnpm.
