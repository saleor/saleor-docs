# Protected API Handlers

The App SDK provides helpers which ensure that incoming requests are sent from the Saleor dashboard.
An example of such a situation could be a change in the application configuration iframe.

> **Warning**
> This handler works only for requests originating from front-end calls. It checks the JWT token from the client, which is available
> in [`AppBridge`](app-bridge). Please do not call this endpoint from the backend context (calling it from API function will fail).

## How to protect the endpoint

First, create a handler for your business logic. The only difference from the usual NextJS handler is an additional argument `ctx` of type `ProtectedHandlerContext`, which contains additional data related to the request:

```typescript
export type ProtectedHandlerContext = {
  baseUrl: string; // the URL your application is available
  authData: AuthData; // Auth Data which can be used to communicate with the Saleor API
  user: {
    email: string;
    userPermissions: string[];
  };
};
```

`createProtectedHandler` will check if:

- the request has `saleor-api-url` header of the Saleor instance
- the API URL has been registered with the help of the APL
- the request has an `authorization-bearer`
- the auth token is a valid JWT token created by the Saleor running on the given URL
- user has required permissions in the token

For example purposes, our endpoint will only log the welcome message:

```typescript
import {
  createProtectedHandler,
} from "@saleor/app-sdk/handlers/next"; // "next" or other platforms
// See APL documentation for more details
import { apl } from "./apl";


/**
 * If any of the requirements is failed, an error response will be returned.
 * Otherwise, provided handler function fill be called.
 *
 * Last argument is optional array of permissions that will be checked. If user doesn't have them, will return 401 before handler is called
 */
export default createProtectedHandler(( request, response, ctx) => {
    console.log(`Greetings from ${ctx.authData.domain}`);
    response.status(200);
}, apl, [
  "MANAGE_ORDERS",
]);
```

Note that argument provided to handler may differ depending on the platform. Next.js pages router will contain `response` but FetchAPI will not.

To make your requests successfully communicate with the backend, `saleor-api-url` and `authorization-bearer` headers are required:

```typescript
import { SALEOR_AUTHORIZATION_BEARER_HEADER, SALEOR_API_URL_HEADER } from "@saleor/app-sdk/headers"

fetch("/api/protected", {
  headers: {
    /**
     * Both API URL and token are available in the appBridgeState. Based on those
     * headers the backend will check if the request has enough permissions to
     * perform the action.
     */
    [SALEOR_API_URL_HEADER]: saleorApiUrl,
    [SALEOR_AUTHORIZATION_BEARER_HEADER]: token,
  },
});
```

If you want to read more about `appBridgeState`, check [App Bridge](./app-bridge.mdx) documentation.

### Using `useAuthenticatedFetch()` hook

Instead of manually attaching headers with AppBridge context, use the `useAuthenticatedFetch()` hook.

Since it requires AppBridge, it's only available in a browser context. It depends on the `window` object, so your app will break if Next.js tries to render it server-side. Hence, ensure the component that uses the hook is imported with dynamic().

The component must be within `AppBridgeProvider` to have access to the AppBridge.

```tsx
import { useAuthenticatedFetch } from "@saleor/app-sdk/app-bridge";
import { useEffect } from "react";

export const ClientComponent = () => {
  const fetch = useAuthenticatedFetch();

  useEffect(() => {
    /**
     * Auth headers are set up automatically, so you can call the fetch function
     */
    fetch("/api/protected");
  }, [fetch]);

  return <div>Your UI</div>;
};
```
