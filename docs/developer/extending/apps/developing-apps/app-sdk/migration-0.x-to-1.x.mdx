# Upgrading From 0.x To 1.x

With 1.x.x release in app-sdk we added support for platforms other than Next.js (pages router). Apart of these features we introduced several breaking changes.

This article shows how to migrate your app from 0.x.x to 1.x.x version of app-sdk.

To install please run `pnpm install @saleor/sdk@1`

See [additional changelog](https://github.com/saleor/app-sdk/releases/tag/v1.0.0)

# New features

Added handlers for platform:
- `/handlers/aws-lambda`
- `/handlers/fetch-api`
- `/handlers/next`
- `/handlers/next-app-router`

Exported `parseSchemaVersion` from `/util`. It parses stringified schema version into a tuple `[number, number]`

# Breaking changes

## Compatibility changes

From 1.x.x minimal (officially) supported Saleor version is 3.20

Minimal Next.js version is 14. It may work on older versions but it's not officially supported.

## Schema version

`schemaVersion` field that was available in Manifest factory and webhook handlers is now parsed into a tuple.

Before:

```typescript
schemaVersion: number
```

After:

```typescript
type SchemaVersion = [major: number, minor: number]

schemaVersion: SchemaVersion
```

Now it's secure that `3.20` is not mixed with `3.2` due to a wrong format.

## APLs export paths

Now every APL is exported from a separate file. This allows tree-shaking - code will not be evaluated if it's not used.

```typescript
// Before
import { FileApl, EnvApl } from '@saleor/app-sdk/APL';

// After
import { FileApl } from '@saleor/app-sdk/APL/file';
import { EnvApl } from '@saleor/app-sdk/APL/env';

```

## Dropping `domain` field

In `AuthData` we dropped `domain` field. Please use `saleorApiUrl` instead which contains full URL, not only domain

Additionally `domain` was removed from `AppBridgeState`. The `saleorApiUrl` field is also available there.

## Moved headers export path

Previously constant values representing headers were exported from `/const` path.

Now, `/const` doesn't exist anymore. All headers are exported from `/headers` path.

## Renamed Nextjs handlers

In v1 we added Next App Router. To make it clear what is used, we renamed old handlers:

```typescript
// Before

import { type NextSyncWebhookHandler } from "@saleor/app-sdk/handlers/next";

// After
import { type NextJsSyncWebhookHandler } from "@saleor/app-sdk/handlers/next";
```

## Removed `verify-jwt` path

You can now import `verifyJwt`, `getJwksUrlFromSaleorApiUrl`, and `verifySignatureWithJwks` from `@saleor/app-sdk/auth` path.

## Removed `buildResponse`

`ctx.buildResponse` was removed from Webhook's context. Now to create a typed response from sync webhook, you can use `buildSyncWebhookResponsePayload` function.


```typescript
import {buildSyncWebhookResponsePayload} from "@saleor/app-sdk/handlers/shared"

const typedResponse = buildSyncWebhookResponsePayload<"CHECKOUT_CALCULATE_TAXES">({/* Input will be typed here */})
```

## Other changes

- `SyncWebhookResponsesMap` is now exported from `@saleor/app-sdk/handlers/shared`
- `asyncEvent` field from `SaleorAsyncWebhook` class constructor was removed. Use `event` instead.
- `requiredEnvVars` parameter no longer is accepted in `SaleorApp` constructor. Please manually validate env variables on the app level. Saleor team recommends [T3 Env](https://env.t3.gg/docs/introduction)
- Removed all exports from `/middlewares`. Use utilities from `/handlers` instead.
- Removed `processSaleorWebhook` and `processProtectedHandler`. Use `./handlers` instead.
- AppBridge now uses `Crypto` API built-in modern browsers. This requires localhost or https to work.
- When creating `MetadataManager`, `deleteMetadata` callback is now required.
