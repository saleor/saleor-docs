The default starter boilerplate, [saleor-app-template](./app-template.mdx) is minimalistic and contains minimum code to install and use with Saleor.

Most likely, you want to learn by examples - that's why there is an example repository that stores patterns, use cases, and integrations with other libraries or vendors.

You can find [saleor/app-examples here](https://github.com/saleor/app-examples)
