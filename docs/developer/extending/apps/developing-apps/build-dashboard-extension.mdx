title: Build a Dashboard extension
---

Dashboard extension is a powerful API allowing to extend the UI of the Dashboard.

This guide will teach you how to build several Dashboard extensions. Each of them are different, depending on the problem you are solving.

Before you proceed, read about writing apps general concepts.

:::note
This guide uses Next.js, TypeScript and @saleor/app-sdk
:::

## Example 1: Generate and download a shipping label for order

In this example we will create a text-like extension, that on click will open a new tab with a PDF file.

The PDF will be generated in the mocked service and will happen server-side.

### Create an endpoint

First we need to create an endpoint that will be responsile for processing the request. It expects order's ID to be passed in the request.

```typescript
// src/app/generate/route.ts

import {NextRequest, NextResonse} from "next";
import {verifyJwt} from "@saleor/app-sdk/auth"
import request from "graphql-request"

import shippingLabelSdk from "shipping-sdk"

const query = gql`
query Order($id: ID) {
  order(id: $id) {
    // todo
  }
}

`

export const POST = async (request: NextRequest): NextResponse => {
    const {orderId, saleorApiUrl, accessToken, appId} = request.body;

    try {
        await verifyJwt({
            token: accessToken,
            appId,
            saleorApiUrl
        })
    }
    catch (e) {
      return new Response("Not authorized", {status: 401})
    }

    const data = await request(query, {id: orderId})

    const result = await shippingLabelSdk.generateLabel({
        address: data.order.user.shippingAddress
    })

    return Response.redirect(result.downloadUrl)

}
```

### Create a manifest

Now we need to tell Saleor to register such an extension. It will be part of the main app Manifest.

```typescript
import { createManifestHandler } from "@saleor/app-sdk/handlers/next";
import { AppManifest } from "@saleor/app-sdk/types";

export default createManifestHandler({
  async manifestFactory({ appBaseUrl, request, schemaVersion }) {
    const manifest: AppManifest = {
      name: "Shipping Label Generator",
      tokenTargetUrl: `${appBaseUrl}/api/register`,
      appUrl: appBaseUrl,
      permissions: [
        "MANAGE_ORDERS",
      ],
      id: "saleor.app.shipping-label",
      version: '1',
      webhooks: [],

      extensions: [
        {
          // Matching your endpoint path
          url: "/generate",
          permissions: [],
          mount: "ORDER_DETAILS_WIDGETS",
          label: "Generate label",
          target: "NEW_TAB",
          options: {
            newTabTarget: {
              method: "POST",
            },
          },
        },
      ],
      author: "Saleor Commerce",
    };

    return manifest;
  },
});
```

That's it. You can install the App and navigate to Order Details. You will see a *Generate label* link rendered by the Dashboard.
Once you click it, your endpoint will be exeucted in the new tab

## Example 2: Show how many orders Customer made

// todo
