Apps allow you to add new functionalities on top of Saleor and integrate it with third-party services.

They can be [installed, managed, and rendered in Saleor Dashboard](extending-dashboard-with-apps).

On the technical level, apps are technology-agnostic clients that communicate with Saleor through webhooks and API.

[Saleor App Store](../../app-store/overview) is a Cloud feature that allows adding integrations with a single click.
