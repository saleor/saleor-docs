## Overview

In this tutorial, we will walk you through the basic steps of building a Saleor app.

By the end of it, you will have built an **Abandoned Checkouts** app. It will fetch and display data about checkouts that for some reason haven't been turned into orders.

Are you unsure about what a Saleor app is? You can find more information about them [here](developer/extending/apps/index.mdx).

While building the app, we will cover:

- the basics of Saleor CLI
- creating an app and modifying its manifest
- installing and displaying the app in the Saleor Dashboard
- querying the data from the Saleor GraphQL API and using it to display a UI

## Prerequisites

### Knowledge

In the tutorial, we will introduce you to some Saleor app concepts. To make the most of them, you need to be familiar with several technologies.

The articles featured in this series will include the basics of:

- [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)
- [GraphQL](https://graphql.org/)
- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/)

Setting aside the purpose of this tutorial, we highly recommend learning them. These technologies make up our standard stack and we use them in all sorts of different applications.

### Saleor CLI

In this tutorial, we will use [Saleor CLI](cli.mdx) to spawn the app boilerplate.

If you haven't installed Saleor CLI, please head over to the [Saleor CLI documentation](/cli.mdx) for the [installation instructions](/cli.mdx#installing-the-cli).

### Saleor account

Before starting the development, please make sure you are logged in to your Saleor Cloud account.

If you have not set up your Saleor Cloud account yet, we suggest following the [Getting started](cloud.mdx#getting-started) guide.
