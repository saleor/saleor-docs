Saleor apps can be written in any programming language as long as it's a Web application conforming to the [app requirements](architecture/app-requirements).

The existing app ecosystem in JavaScript can help you get up and running quickly.

## JavaScript

The simplest way to create a Saleor app is to use [Saleor CLI](/cli/overview.mdx):

```bash
saleor app template my-saleor-app
```

or

with `npx`

```bash
npx saleor app template my-saleor-app
```

CLI clones the [Saleor App Template](developing-apps/app-template) repository and installs dependencies. Saleor recommends using [Saleor CLI](/cli/overview.mdx) as it provides more commands for the App development.

While the process is done, `cd` into the App folder and start the App:

```bash
cd my-saleor-app
pnpm dev
```

That's it! Your app should be up and running.

## Other languages

### Python

While Saleor doesn't provide an official template for Python apps, we can recommend using [`mirumee/saleor-app-framework-python`](https://github.com/mirumee/saleor-app-framework-python). It was created by our partner [Mirumee Software](https://github.com/mirumee), with some contributions from core Saleor members.
