title: App Requirements
---

If you want to build your App from scratch, you should know that to make it installable in the Dashboard, the App requires implementation of following endpoints:

- [Manifest URL](#manifest-url) - to get your app's metadata.
- [Register URL](#register-url) - to exchange the app token.

:::info
We recommend using [Saleor App Template](developer/extending/apps/developing-apps/app-template.mdx) as a starting point for building your App. It provides all the necessary boilerplate needed to focus on your app's logic.

## Manifest URL

- Method: `GET`
- Response - `JSON` with a valid [App Manifest](developer/extending/apps/architecture/manifest.mdx)
- Suggested path: `/api/manifest`

Saleor will call this endpoint to get your App metadata. It returns the App's name and description, as well as all the necessary information to register webhooks, permissions, and extensions.

Dashboard and Saleor API will use this endpoint to retrieve information needed to install the App.

To learn more about what Manifest consists of, please check the [Manifest docs](developer/extending/apps/architecture/manifest.mdx) or explore its [type](https://github.com/saleor/saleor-app-sdk/blob/main/src/types.ts#L67).

If your App is built with [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/), you can use a [helper from @saleor/app-sdk](https://github.com/saleor/saleor-app-sdk/blob/main/docs/api-handlers.md#manifest-handler-factory) that creates a Manifest handler with minimal config.

## Register URL

- Method: `POST`
- Response - status `200`
- Suggested path - `/api/register`

During the installation of an App, Saleor will call a second critical endpoint.

When calling the "register" endpoint, Saleor will add the `auth_token` param to the request body and domain header. The App's job is to save the token and use it to run API calls.

While we suggest `/api/register` path, it can be configured in [Manifest](developer/extending/apps/architecture/manifest.mdx) with the `tokenTargetUrl` field.

You can write this endpoint on your own, but we recommend using a [helper](https://github.com/saleor/saleor-app-sdk/blob/main/docs/api-handlers.md#app-register-handler-factory) provided by `@saleor/app-sdk`.

To use this helper, you must provide a valid [Auth Persistence Layer - APL](developer/extending/apps/architecture/apl.mdx), that will handle storing token and domain pairs for your App.
