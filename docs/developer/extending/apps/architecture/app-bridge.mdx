title: App Bridge
---

AppBridge is a part of [app-sdk](../developing-apps/app-sdk/overview.mdx) npm package. You can import it from `"@saleor/app-sdk/app-bridge"`.

The goal of the AppBridge module is to provide communication (a bridge) between Saleor Dashboard and App.

:::info
The whole communication is performed in the browser - it won't work in the Node context.

# Docs

The most recent docs can be found in the [app-sdk repository](https://github.com/saleor/saleor-app-sdk/blob/main/docs/app-bridge.md).

# Events and Actions

AppBridge provides bi-directional communication between Saleor Dashboard and the App (in an iframe context)

## Events

Events are sent from Dashboard, and App can listen to them.

With events, the App can react, e.g., to theme changes or receive a token with a handshake event.

You can find all events [here](https://github.com/saleor/saleor-app-sdk/blob/main/docs/app-bridge.mdx#events).

## Actions

Actions are sent from App to Dashboard. With actions dispatch, App can ask Dashboard to redirect or show a notification.

You can find all actions [here](https://github.com/saleor/saleor-app-sdk/blob/main/docs/app-bridge.mdx#actions).
