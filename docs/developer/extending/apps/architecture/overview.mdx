# Overview

## App Manifest

The App manifest is a JSON file that describes the application details, including name and version. It lists the required by the App [permissions](/developer/permissions.mdx#app-permissions). Defines App [mounting points in the Dashboard](developer/extending/apps/extending-dashboard-with-apps.mdx) and specify the [Auth Persistence](developer/extending/apps/architecture/apl.mdx).

## App Requirements

Saleor API requires two endpoints to be implemented on the App side - the [Manifest URL](developer/extending/apps/architecture/app-requirements.mdx#manifest-url) and [Register URL](developer/extending/apps/architecture/app-requirements.mdx#register-url).

## Communication with Saleor API

Depending on App needs it can communicate with the Saleor API using events based on webhooks or with Saleor GraphQL API. Check ["Communicating with apps"](developer/extending/apps/architecture/communication-between-app-and-saleor.mdx) for more details.

## Auth Persistence

Saleor Apps communicate with Saleor API using `token` - obtained during App registration process. The [Auth Persistence Layer](developer/extending/apps/architecture/apl.mdx) page describes the ways you can store obtained `token` depending on your App needs.

<!-- ## Permissions

The App access can be granularly assigned per-app basis. During installation, the user can choose which permissions to grant. Read [permissions guide](developer/permissions.mdx) to learn more.

All requests from the dashboard view have the staff user JWT token so that additional permission checks can be done on the app side. The token contains permissions, being a common set of staff user and app permissions. -->

<!-- ## Verifying payload

To ensure that the incoming webhook payload is from a known host, Saleor adds the `Saleor-Signature` header to the request. [Read more](developer/extending/webhooks/asynchronous-events.mdx#https).

- `local`: create a custom app instance and assign explicitly provided permissions. The app is fully manageable from the dashboard. You can change the assigned permissions and add webhooks or authentication tokens. With a `local` app, you can create an integration with some services which will parse the webhook payload. -->

:::info
If you're building a single service dedicated only to your shop, check [Webhooks](developer/extending/webhooks/overview.mdx) section of [Extending dashboard](developer/extending/overview.mdx#webhooks) as it may handle all your needs.
