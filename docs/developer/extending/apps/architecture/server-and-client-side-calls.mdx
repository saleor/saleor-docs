title: Server and client side calls
---

Usually, apps are built on top of two communication methods - webhooks and API requests.
While webhooks are always server-side (Saleor core calls the backend of your app),
API requests from App to Saleor can be both server and client (frontend) sides.

This article highlights main differences of both approaches.

## Two types of tokens

Saleor App API uses two types of tokens:

- AppToken - used for server-side calls
- AccessToken - used for client-side calls

### AppToken

AppToken is an infinite token generated when the App is being installed. Saleor will call `tokenTargetUrl` from the [App Manifest](./manifest.mdx) and the App needs to store the token in the safe place
if it wants to consume the Saleor API. Official Saleor Apps and [app-sdk](../developing-apps/app-sdk/overview.mdx) uses [APL concept](./apl.mdx) to store the token.

The AppToken is recommended to use for server-side calls.
It represents App itself and doesn't store any user information. It doesn't expire, so it should not be exposed to the front end.

### AccessToken

AccessToken is a [JWT token](https://jwt.io/) that represents a user. It is generated once the user opens the App frontend in the Dashboard.
The Dashboard provides the token to the App using [AppBridge](../developing-apps/app-sdk/app-bridge).

This token expires, and the dashboard refreshes it in the background. In case of any leak, it will eventually expire and become useless.
Hence it's better for client-side calls due to the security concerns.

AccessToken is unique for the user - it stores user and permissions in its payload.
Permissions of the token are an intersection of the user's and the app's permissions.
This mechanism prevents the App from performing more operations than allowed.

### Tokens comparison

| Behavior  | AppToken                  | AuthToken                                                                   |
| --------- | ------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Creation  | During installation       | When user opens the App                                                     |
| Lifespan  | Infinite                  | Finite, configurable in Saleor. Automatically refreshed with Refresh Tokens |
| User data | Doesn't store             | Stores user and user's permissions                                          |
| Storage   | Should be stored securely | Stored in the memory automatically                                          |

This should give us a basic understanding of the tokens and their usage now. Let's see how to use them in practice.

## Saleor API calls - examples

Let's cover a few popular scenarios and evaluate which token suits best to be used.

### Safely submit app's configuration form

Imagine your app contains 2 parts:

1. Frontend with html `<form>` that contains configuration fields
2. Api endpoint `POST /config` that saves the configuration

How to prevent the rogue user from calling the endpoint directly and bypassing the front end?

_AccessToken_ can help with that. The app frontend should attach AccessToken to the header and the backend can verify it.

The app-sdk providers a helper function for this (Next.js only):

```typescript
// pages/config.tsx

import { createProtectedHandler } from "@saleor/app-sdk/handlers/next";

export default createProtectedHandler(
  (req, res, ctx) => {
    // Request is authenticated at this point.
    // Additionally it checks if the user has MANAGE_ORDERS permission!

    return res.status(200).json({ success: true });
  },
  saleorApp.apl,
  ["MANAGE_ORDERS"]
);
```

Read more in [app-sdk docs](../developing-apps/app-sdk/protected-handlers)

### Call Saleor API during app installation

Saleor app installation is a server-side process. Saleor calls the `tokenTargetUrl` and provides _AppToken_ in the payload.

At this point, the app can call Saleor API using the AppToken.

Since the front-end is not available to the user, there is no way to obtain AccessToken.

### Call Saleor API from the webhook handler

Webhooks are always server-side calls. If the app needs more data than it can obtain via subscription query, it can call Saleor API using _AppToken_.
The app-sdk provides factories for webhooks that extract AppToken from the request and provides it to the handler.
You can read more [here](../developing-apps/app-sdk/saleor-webhook)

### Call Saleor API from the front-end and display the result

Many apps will operate on the front-end. For example - the app that fetches many products and allows to edit them in bulk.

If the app contains `MANAGE_PRODUCTS` permission, both _AuthToken_ and _AppToken_ will be permitted to read and write products from the API.

At this point, it's up to you how to handle the request:

1. Call Saleor directly using AuthToken. This is the easiest way.
2. Call your own endpoint, which will call Saleor API using AppToken.
