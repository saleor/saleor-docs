Saleor needs two endpoints that your app must expose

Manifest URL - to get your app's metadata
Register URL - to exchange App Token

# Manifest URL

- Method: `GET`
- Response - `JSON` with valid [App Manifest](https://docs.saleor.io/docs/3.x/developer/extending/apps/manifest)
- Suggested path - `/api/manifest`

Saleor will call this endpoint to get your app metadata, like name and description, but first of all - to register webhooks, permissions, and extensions.

See [Manifest docs](https://docs.saleor.io/docs/3.x/developer/extending/apps/manifest) or check its [typings](https://github.com/saleor/saleor-app-sdk/blob/main/src/types.ts#L67).

If your app is built with [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/), you can use a [helper from saleor/app-sdk](https://github.com/saleor/saleor-app-sdk/blob/main/docs/api-handlers.md#manifest-handler-factory), that creates a handler with minimal config.

Dashboard and Saleor API will use this endpoint to install the app.

# Register URL

- Method: `POST`
- Response - status `200`
- Suggested path - `/api/register`

When Saleor installs the app, it will call a 2nd critical endpoint.

Saleor will add `auth_token` param to the request body and domain header. The app should save this token and use it to run API calls.

While we suggest `/api/register` path, it can be configured in [Manifest](https://docs.saleor.io/docs/3.x/developer/extending/apps/manifest) with `tokenTargetUrl` field.

You can write this endpoint on your own, but saleor/app-sdk exports a [helper](https://github.com/saleor/saleor-app-sdk/blob/main/docs/api-handlers.md#app-register-handler-factory) for that

To use this helper, you must provide a valid [APL](https://github.com/saleor/saleor-app-sdk/blob/main/docs/apl.md), that will handle storing token and domain pairs for your app.
