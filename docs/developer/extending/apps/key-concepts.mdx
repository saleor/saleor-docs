## Architecture

Saleor Apps are separate applications that use GraphQL to talk to a Saleor server and that can receive webhooks with event notifications from Saleor.

## Authentication

Unlike regular users, Saleor Apps use a bearer token. The token is assigned at App installation time and needs to be stored in a secure manner.

The authorization header for Apps has the following format:

```http
Authorization: Bearer <app-token>
```

## The App manifest

The App manifest is a JSON file that describes the application, including its name, version, required permissions, and how it handles the store's data.

Saleor expects the manifest to use the following format:

```json
{
  "id": "example.app.wonderful",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "name": "My Wonderful App",
  "about": "My Wonderful App is a wonderful App for Saleor.",

  "permissions": ["MANAGE_USERS", "MANAGE_STAFF"],

  "appUrl": "http://localhost:3000/app",
  "configurationUrl": "htpp://localhost:3000/configuration",
  "tokenTargetUrl": "http://localhost:3000/register",

  "dataPrivacy": "Lorem ipsum",
  "dataPrivacyUrl": "http://localhost:3000/app-data-privacy",
  "homepageUrl": "http://localhost:3000/homepage",
  "supportUrl": "http://localhost:3000/support"
}
```
:::note
During an installation of third-party App, Saleor will try to send an authentication token to provided `tokenTargetUrl`.

#### HTTP(S)

Webhook payloads are sent in POST requests.

All webhooks with `targetUrl`, where the scheme is HTTP(S) will use this protocol.

Saleor calculates the HMAC sha256 header - `X-Saleor-Signature` based on `secretKey` and the payload


#### Google Cloud Pub/Sub

All webhooks where scheme is `gcpubsub` will be treated as a Google Cloud Pub/Sub webhooks.
The structure of `targetUrl` should be as below:
```
gcpubsub://cloud.google.com/projects/<yourproject>/topics/<yourtopic>
```

To proper use the Google Cloud Pub/Sub you need to set the [`GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS` environment variable](https://cloud.google.com/pubsub/docs/quickstart-client-libraries) 


#### AWS SQS

All webhooks where scheme is `awssqs` will be treated as AWS SQS webhooks.

The structure of `targetUrl` should be as below:
```
awssqs://<access_key_id>:<secret_access_key>@sqs.<region>.amazonaws.com/<account_id>/<queue_name>
```


## Type of Apps
- `local`: create a custom App instance, assign explicitly provided permissions. 
The app is fully manageable from dashboard. You can change assigned permissions, add webhooks, or authentication token. 
`local` app can be useful for creating integration with some services which will parse the webhook payload.  
:::note
If you're building a single service dedicated only to your shop this solution will handle all your needs.
:::

- `third-party`: install App in Saleor and proceed with all required steps to prepare the communication channel for App.  
Installation is fully automated.  Saleor uses a defined App manifest to gather all required information.  
If there are no errors during the installation, App gets the possibility to attach to Saleor Dashboard over the iframe, 
communicate with Saleor over API and use webhooks to subscribe for the given events.
:::note
If you're building an App that will be published in the marketplace, then this solution is dedicated to you.
