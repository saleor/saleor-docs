## Architecture

Saleor Apps are separate applications that use GraphQL to talk to a Saleor server and receive webhooks with event notifications from Saleor. If the event payload lacks any data essential for the app, additional data can be queried using GraphQL. In addition, Saleor's API has exposed all the actions available from the dashboard, so your app can fully extend your shop behavior.

## Type of Apps
- `local`: create a custom App instance, assign explicitly provided permissions. 
The app is fully manageable from dashboard. You can change assigned permissions, add webhooks, or authentication token. 
`local` app can be useful for creating integration with some services which will parse the webhook payload.  
:::note
If you're building a single service dedicated only to your shop this solution will handle all your needs.
:::

- `third-party`: install App in Saleor and proceed with all required steps to prepare the communication channel for App.  
Installation is fully automated.  Saleor uses a defined App manifest to gather all required information.  
If there are no errors during the installation, App gets the possibility to attach to Saleor Dashboard over the iframe, 
communicate with Saleor over API and use webhooks to subscribe for the given events.
:::note
If you're building an App that will be published in the marketplace, then this solution is dedicated to you.

## Dashboard integration

If your application needs additional configuration or presents data to the user, you can implement configuration and app view, which is being displayed as an iframe at the dashboard.

## The App manifest

The App manifest is a JSON file that describes the application, including its name, version, required permissions, and how it handles the store's data.

To read more, see [App manifest](developer/extending/apps/manifest.mdx) section.

## Permissions

App access can be granularly assigned per-app basis. During installation, the user can choose which permissions are granted. Read [permissions guide](developer/permissions.mdx) to learn more.

All requests from dashboard view have staff user JWT token, so additional permission checks can be done on the app side. The token contains permissions which are the common set of staff user and app permissions.

## Authentication

Unlike regular users, Saleor Apps use a bearer token. The token is assigned at App installation time and needs to be stored in a secure manner.

The authorization header for Apps has the following format:

```http
Authorization: Bearer <app-token>
```

## Verifying incoming payload - the secret key

To ensure that the incoming webhook payload is from the known host, Saleor adds `Saleor-Signature` header to the request. It's created using payload and `secretKey`, specified by the app during webhook registration. [Read more](developer/extending/apps/asynchronous-webhooks.mdx#https).
