## Architecture

Saleor Apps are separate applications that use GraphQL to talk to a Saleor server and that can receive webhooks with event notifications from Saleor.

## Authentication

Unlike regular users, Saleor Apps use a bearer token. The token is assigned at App installation time and needs to be stored in a secure manner.

The authorization header for Apps has the following format:

```http
Authorization: Bearer <app-token>
```

## The App manifest

The App manifest is a JSON file that describes the application, including its name, version, required permissions, and how it handles the store's data.

Saleor expects the manifest to use the following format:

```json
{
  "id": "example.app.wonderful",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "name": "My Wonderful App",
  "about": "My Wonderful App is a wonderful App for Saleor.",

  "permissions": ["MANAGE_USERS", "MANAGE_STAFF"],

  "appUrl": "http://localhost:3000/app",
  "configurationUrl": "htpp://localhost:3000/configuration",
  "tokenTargetUrl": "http://localhost:3000/register",

  "dataPrivacy": "Lorem ipsum",
  "dataPrivacyUrl": "http://localhost:3000/app-data-privacy",
  "homepageUrl": "http://localhost:3000/homepage",
  "supportUrl": "http://localhost:3000/support"
}
```
:::note
During an installation of third-party App, Saleor will try to send an authentication token to provided `tokenTargetUrl`.

### Webhook protocols

Webhooks support below protocols:

- HTTP(S) 
- Google Cloud Pub/Sub
- AWS SQS

#### HTTP(S)

Webhook payloads are sent in POST requests.

All webhooks with `targetUrl`, where the scheme is HTTP(S) will use this protocol.

Saleor calculates the HMAC sha256 header - `X-Saleor-Signature` based on `secretKey` and the payload


#### Google Cloud Pub/Sub

All webhooks where scheme is `gcpubsub` will be treated as a Google Cloud Pub/Sub webhooks.
The structure of `targetUrl` should be as below:
```
gcpubsub://cloud.google.com/projects/<yourproject>/topics/<yourtopic>
```

To proper use the Google Cloud Pub/Sub you need to set the [`GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS` environment variable](https://cloud.google.com/pubsub/docs/quickstart-client-libraries) 


#### AWS SQS

All webhooks where scheme is `awssqs` will be treated as AWS SQS webhooks.

The structure of `targetUrl` should be as below:
```
awssqs://<access_key_id>:<secret_access_key>@sqs.<region>.amazonaws.com/<account_id>/<queue_name>
```

:::note
FIFO queues (ending in `.fifo`) must be configured to have `ContentBasedDeduplication` enabled.
`MessageGroupID` will be set to current [`Site`](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/ref/contrib/sites/)'s domain name.
:::


### Payment webhooks

Payment webhooks are synchronous webhooks that allow delegating payment handling to Saleor Apps. Synchronous means that these webhooks expect a response of a particular shape to be returned from the app to continue processing in Saleor. Payment webhooks only support HTTP(S) protocol; they are sent as POST requests with `application/json` body and expect a response of the same content type.

Available payment events are:

| Name                        | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                             |

To create an app that reacts to payment webhook, you need first to create a regular app, as described in [this dashboard manual](/dashboard/apps.md). Make sure to make the app active and grant it the `HANDLE_PAYMENTS` permission.

#### Register `PAYMENT_LIST_GATEWAYS` webhook

When enabling payment webhooks, you need to first subscribe to `PAYMENT_LIST_GATEWAYS` event. This event is called whenever Saleor is listing available payment gateways, either in API or internal use. This webhook needs to return information about payment methods that are defined in your app.

Below are two example cases when `PAYMENT_LIST_GATEWAYS` is triggered:

##### Listing all available payment gateways

This query returns information about available payment gateways without any additional context:

```graphql
{
  shop {
    availablePaymentGateways(currency: "USD", channel: "default-channel") {
      name
      id
      config {
        field
        value
      }
      currencies
    }
  }
}
```

The `availablePaymentGateways` field accepts the optional `currency` argument; if provided, it will be passed in the webhook payload and can be used to return payment methods that support a particular currency.

##### Listing available payment gateways for a checkout

You can also query for available payment gateways in the context of a specific checkout. This is useful if payment methods depend on the current checkout (e.g. user’s shipping country etc.)

```graphql
{
  checkout(token: "checkout-uuid-token") {
    availablePaymentGateways {
      name
    }
  }
}
```

See the example payload sent from Saleor for this event: [List payment gateways payload](/developer/extending/apps/sample-webhook-payloads.mdx#list-payment-gateways-payload).

##### Expected webhook response

In the response, you should return a list of supported payment methods, for example:

```json
[
   {
      "id":"credit-card",
      "name":"Credit Card",
      "currencies":[
         "EUR"
      ],
      "config":[]
   },
   {
      "id":"apple-pay",
      "name":"Apple Pay",
      "currencies":[
         "EUR",
         "USD"
      ],
      "config":[
         {
            "field":"apple-pay-config-field",
            "value":"value"
         }
      ]
   }
]
```

Each item on the list should have the following fields:
- `id` - ID of a payment method; must be unique within your app.
- `name` - the name of the payment method.
- `currencies` - list of currencies supported by this payment method.
- `config` - optional configuration, such as additional payment data that may be needed to proceed with the payment in the frontend.


#### Register webhooks for payment actions

To subscribe to particular payment events (such as capture or authorization), you can have multiple webhooks with separate URLs for each action, or a single webhook that handles all events (each webhook has `X-Saleor-Event` header which contains the type of event).

List of payment events: 

- `PAYMENT_AUTHORIZE`
- `PAYMENT_CAPTURE`
- `PAYMENT_CONFIRM`
- `PAYMENT_PROCESS`
- `PAYMENT_REFUND`
- `PAYMENT_VOID`

:::note
If an app has more than one webhook that listens to the same payment event, Saleor will always pick the first webhook from the list.
:::

See the example payload sent from Saleor for these payment events: [Payment actions payload](/developer/extending/apps/sample-webhook-payloads.mdx#payment-actions-payload).

##### Expected response

In response for the above payment events, you should return the following transaction details:

```json
{
   "action_required":false,
   "action_required_data":{},
   "amount": "29.26",
   "currency": "USD",
   "customer_id":"example-customer-id",
   "error":"None",
   "payment_method": {
     "brand":"Visa",
     "exp_month":"01",
     "exp_year":"2025",
     "last_4":"4242",
     "name":"John Doe",
     "type":"Credit card",
   },
   "psp_reference": "",
   "transaction_id":"example-transaction-id",
   "transaction_already_processed": "False"
}
```

The response fields match with the `GatewayResponse` data class used in Saleor to represent a response from a payment gateway; you can read more about these fields [here](/developer/extending/payment-gateways.mdx#gatewayresponse).

#### Use payment webhook's payment method in checkout

If payment webhooks are configured properly, you can use their payment methods in checkout. To do this, you need to [list available payment methods for your checkout or shop](/developer/extending/apps/key-concepts.mdx#listing-all-available-payment-gateways). Each payment method from a payment webhook has an ID of this format: `app:<app-database-id>:<id-returned-by-webhook>`

Example: `app:1:credit-card`

To use this gateway in checkout, run `checkoutPaymentCreate` mutation and pass this ID as the `gateway` parameter:

```graphql
mutation {
  checkoutPaymentCreate(
    checkoutId: "example-checkout-id"
    input: { gateway: "app:1:credit-card", amount: 22.36 }
  ) {
    payment {
      id
    }
  }
}
```

Running the `checkoutComplete` mutation afterward will use the payment method set above and trigger your payment webhook.

See more about checkout mutations [here](developer/checkout.mdx).


## Type of Apps
- `local`: create a custom App instance, assign explicitly provided permissions. 
The app is fully manageable from dashboard. You can change assigned permissions, add webhooks, or authentication token. 
`local` app can be useful for creating integration with some services which will parse the webhook payload.  
:::note
If you're building a single service dedicated only to your shop this solution will handle all your needs.
:::

- `third-party`: install App in Saleor and proceed with all required steps to prepare the communication channel for App.  
Installation is fully automated.  Saleor uses a defined App manifest to gather all required information.  
If there are no errors during the installation, App gets the possibility to attach to Saleor Dashboard over the iframe, 
communicate with Saleor over API and use webhooks to subscribe for the given events.
:::note
If you're building an App that will be published in the marketplace, then this solution is dedicated to you.
