title: App manifest

The App manifest is a JSON file that describes the application, including its name, version, required permissions, and how it handles the store's data.

Saleor expects the manifest to use the following format:

  "version": "1.0.0",
  "name": "My Wonderful App",
  "about": "My Wonderful App is a wonderful App for Saleor.",

  "permissions": ["MANAGE_USERS", "MANAGE_STAFF"],

  "configurationUrl": "htpp://localhost:3000/configuration",
  "tokenTargetUrl": "http://localhost:3000/register",

  "dataPrivacy": "Lorem ipsum",
  "dataPrivacyUrl": "http://localhost:3000/app-data-privacy",
