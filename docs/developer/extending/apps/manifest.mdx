title: The App Manifest
---

The App manifest is a JSON file that describes the application, including its name, version, required permissions, and how it handles the store's data.

Saleor expects the manifest to use the following format:

```json
{
  "id": "example.app.wonderful",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "name": "My Wonderful App",
  "about": "My Wonderful App is a wonderful App for Saleor.",

  "permissions": ["MANAGE_USERS", "MANAGE_STAFF"],

  "appUrl": "http://localhost:3001/app",
  "configurationUrl": "htpp://localhost:3001/configuration",
  "tokenTargetUrl": "http://localhost:3001/register",

  "dataPrivacy": "Lorem ipsum",
  "dataPrivacyUrl": "http://localhost:3001/app-data-privacy",
  "homepageUrl": "http://localhost:3001/homepage",
  "supportUrl": "http://localhost:3001/support",
  "extensions": [
    {

      "url": "https://example.com/extension/"
    },
    {

      "target": "APP_PAGE",
      "permissions": ["MANAGE_PRODUCTS"],
      "url": "/extension/redirect"
    }
  ],
  "webhooks": [
    {
      "name": "Order created",
      "events": ["ORDER_CREATED"],
      "query": "subscription { event { ... on OrderCreated { order { id }}}}",
      "targetUrl": "https://example.com/api/webhooks/order-created",
      "isActive": false
    },
    {

      "events": ["ORDER_CREATED", "ORDER_FULLY_PAID"],
      "query": "subscription { event { ... on OrderCreated { order { id }} ... on OrderFullyPaid { order { id }}}}",
      "targetUrl": "https://example.com/api/webhooks/order-event",
      "isActive": true
