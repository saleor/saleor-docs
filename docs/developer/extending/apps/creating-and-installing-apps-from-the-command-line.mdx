Saleor provides commands that can be used to create/install an App from the command line.

## Creating local Apps

To create a local App with explicitly provided permissions use the `create_app` command.


Arguments:

- `<name>`: the name of the App, required.
- `--permission <PERM>`: assign permission `PERM` to the App. This argument can be repeated to specify multiple permissions.
- `--activate`: immediately activate the new App.
- `--target-url <URL>`: URL to send the API auth token to once installation is complete. [Optional]

> **Example:** The following command will create an App named "Order App" that can access users and orders:
>
> ```shell
> python manage.py create_app "Order App" \
>    --permission MANAGE_USERS \
>    --permission MANAGE_ORDERS \
>    --target-url https://your-order-app/your-register-endpoint/
> ```


If the target URL is provided, Saleor will POST the API auth token, in the same JSON format, to the provided URL:

  sequenceDiagram
    Saleor ->> App: POST /token/target/url/<br>{"auth_token": "new-app-token"}
    App -->> Saleor: HTTP 200 OK
`}
/>


If the target URL is not specified, the command will output an API auth token in the following format:

```shell
{"auth_token": "new-app-token"}
```

## Installing third-party Apps

To install a `third-party` App based on its manifest URL, use the `install_app` command.

Arguments:

- `<manifest URL>`: URL of the manifest file, required.
- `--activate`: immediately activate the new App.


> **Example:** The following command will download given manifest and install the app:
>
> ```shell
> python manage.py install_app https://www.url.to.manifest
> ```


App installation is confirmed by sending an API token to the specified token target URL.
