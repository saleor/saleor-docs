title: Asynchronous Webhooks
---

## Architecture

Asynchronous webhooks can be used for reacting to the events emitted by Saleor. The worker instance will send the event payload via the chosen protocol. Your App should acknowledge receiving that payload. The result of the App operations is not sent back to the Saleor. If you need to send data back to the user (for example, calculated shipping cost), you should use a [synchronous webhook](developer/extending/apps/synchronous-webhooks/key-concepts.mdx).

## Examples of the use cases

- Sending an order confirmation to the company chat.
- Synchronizing stocks with an external warehousing system.
- Updating Elasticsearch or Algolia indexes after changing product descriptions.
- Triggering frontend SSR for new pages.

## Permissions

Managing webhooks is available for users with the `MANAGE_APPS` permission. The App can also create and modify its own webhooks without the need for additional permissions.

## Webhook protocols

Asynchronous webhooks support the following protocols:

- HTTP(S)
- Google Cloud Pub/Sub
- AWS SQS

A protocol is chosen based on the `targetUrl` scheme.

### HTTP(S)

Webhook payloads are sent in POST requests.

All webhooks with `targetUrl`, where the scheme is HTTP(S) will use this protocol.

If a successful response has not been received in the case of temporary service unavailability, it will retry its request after a delay in time.

While HTTPS webhooks are a familiar concept and may seem easy to implement, ensure your endpoint can handle the same level of concurrency that you expect from the monitored events. Saleor Cloud will do its best to deliver webhooks in real time, which could mean more traffic than your servers can handle. Because of this and the possibility of losing events when the destination server is down, we recommend using a queue like Google Cloud Pub/Sub or AWS SQS (see below).

#### Headers

During HTTPS requests there are several headers included:

- `Saleor-Event` - defines an event which is assigned to the webhook
- `Saleor-Domain` - defines a saleor domain
- `Saleor-Signature` - defines a signature to indicate that the request is verifiable

:::warning
In Saleor 4.0 all `X-Saleor-` headers will be removed and replaced with headers without `X-` prefix.

Deprecated headers list:

- `X-Saleor-Event` -> `Saleor-Event`
- `X-Saleor-Domain` -> `Saleor-Domain`
- `X-Saleor-Signature` -> `Saleor-Signature`

:::

#### Payload signature

Saleor calculates a payload signature under `Saleor-Signature`:

- if `secretKey` was set for a webhook - the HMAC SHA-256 header based on it and the payload
- if `secretKey` wasn't set for a webhook - the JWS signature using RS256 with payload detached, to verify the signature you can use a public key, which can be fetched from `http(s)://<your-backend-domain>/.well-known/jwks.json` (available since Saleor 3.5, before 3.5 the payload from webhooks without `secretKey` set were not signed)

##### Validating signature

To validate signatures in Saleor Apps, use [`withWebhookSignatureVerified`](https://github.com/saleor/saleor-app-sdk/blob/main/src/middleware.ts#L62) middleware provided by [`@saleor/app-sdk`](https://github.com/saleor/saleor-app-sdk)

```js
import type { Handler } from "retes";
import { Response } from "retes/response";
import { toNextHandler } from "retes/adapter";
import {
  withSaleorEventMatch,
  withWebhookSignatureVerified,
} from "@saleor/app-sdk/middleware";

const handler: Handler = async (request) => {
  // ...

  return Response.OK({ success: true });
};

export default toNextHandler([
  withSaleorDomainMatch,
  withWebhookSignatureVerified(),
  handler,
]);
```

You can also manually validate the JWS signature in JavaScript with the [`jose` package](https://github.com/panva/jose). Remember that you need to supply it with a raw body string, not a parsed object.

```js
import getRawBody from "raw-body";

const JWKS = jose.createRemoteJWKSet(
  new URL("https://master.staging.saleor.cloud" + "/.well-known/jwks.json")
);

// In Next.js you need to disable `bodyParser` in order to get raw body string
// https://github.com/vercel/next.js/discussions/12517
export const config = {
  api: {
    bodyParser: false,
  },
};

export default function(req, res) {
  const jws = req.headers["saleor-signature"];
  const buffer = getRawBody(req, {
    length: req.headers["content-length"],
    limit: "1mb",
  });
  const [header, _, signature] = jws.split(".");
  try {
    await jose.flattenedVerify({
      protected: header,
      payload: buffer.toString("utf-8"),
      signature
    }, JWKS);
  } catch (e) {
    // return error
  }

  // handle your request
}
```

### Google Cloud Pub/Sub

All webhooks with the `gcpubsub` scheme will be treated as the Google Cloud Pub/Sub webhooks.
The structure of the `targetUrl` scheme should be as below:

```
gcpubsub://cloud.google.com/projects/<yourproject>/topics/<yourtopic>
```

To use the Google Cloud Pub/Sub properly, you need to set the [`GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS` environment variable](https://cloud.google.com/pubsub/docs/quickstart-client-libraries).

### AWS SQS

All webhooks with the `awssqs` scheme will be treated as AWS SQS webhooks.

The structure of `targetUrl` should be as below:

```
awssqs://<access_key_id>:<secret_access_key>@sqs.<region>.amazonaws.com/<account_id>/<queue_name>
```

:::note
FIFO queues (ending in `.fifo`) must be configured to have `ContentBasedDeduplication` enabled.
`MessageGroupID` will be set to current [`Site`](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/ref/contrib/sites/)'s domain name.

## Available webhook events

Webhooks can be used to receive data from Saleor when particular events happen. The available events are:

| Name                            | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |

## Managing app webhooks

After installation, the App can create a webhook subscription. To manage its own webhooks, no additional permissions are needed. If requests contain the app token in the `Authentication` header, the `app` argument will be automatically populated with the corresponding App.

### Subscribing to a webhook

To subscribe to a webhook, we need to first create an App with proper permissions. Let's assume that we want to extend the order processing app. The App should receive notifications whenever new orders are created in Saleor. To do so, we'll create a new webhook using the `webhookCreate` mutation. The mutation takes the following input:

- `name`: the name of the webhook.
- `targetUrl`: the URL of a service that will receive webhooks requests.
- `events`: a list of the events to subscribe to.
- `app`: the ID of the App to which the webhook belongs. Can be ommited, if the request has the `Authentication` header with the App access token.
- `isActive`: whether to activate the webhook.
- `secretKey` argument is optional, but recommended for [validating](developer/extending/apps/asynchronous-webhooks.mdx#https) incoming payloads.

```graphql {2-10}
mutation {
  webhookCreate(
    input: {
      name: "New orders notification"
      targetUrl: "https://order-processing-service.example.com"
      events: [ORDER_CREATED]
      app: "QXBwOjk="
      isActive: true
      secretKey: "secret-key"
    }
  ) {
    webhook {
      id
    }
    webhookErrors {
      field
      code
    }
  }
}
```

If there are no errors in the response, the webhook is successfully created. From now on, whenever a new order is placed, the payload with the order data will be sent to your `targetUrl`.

### Updating a webhook

To update a webhook (e.g. to deactivate it or change the permissions), use the `webhookUpdate` mutation. The mutation takes similar input fields as the `webhookCreate` mutation. The example below shows how to deactive a webhook:

```graphql {2}
mutation {
  webhookUpdate(id: "V2ViaG9vazox", input: { isActive: false }) {
    webhook {
      isActive
    }
    webhookErrors {
      field
      code
    }
  }
}
```

### Removing a webhook

To fully remove a webhook, use the `webhookDelete` mutation:

```graphql {2}
mutation {
  webhookDelete(id: "V2ViaG9vazox") {
    webhookErrors {
      field
      code
    }
  }
}
```
