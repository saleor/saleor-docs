title: Synchronous Webhooks
---

## Introduction

Synchronous webhooks can be used for extending Saleor without the need to deploy plugins on the API server.

:::warning
Adding synchronous webhooks will affect Saleor API response time. Make sure that the App server can keep up with customer's requests.
:::

These webhooks are run from the Saleor Core instance during GraphQL requests and response data will be passed to the client.

## Payment webhooks

Payment webhooks are synchronous webhooks that allow delegating payment handling to Saleor Apps. Synchronous means that these webhooks expect a response of a particular shape to be returned from the app to continue processing in Saleor. Payment webhooks only support HTTP(S) protocol; they are sent as POST requests with `application/json` body and expect a response of the same content type.

Available payment events are:

| Name                        | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| --------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `PAYMENT_AUTHORIZE`         | Authorize payment                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| `PAYMENT_CAPTURE`           | Capture payment                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| `PAYMENT_CONFIRM`           | Confirm payment                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| `PAYMENT_LIST_GATEWAYS`     | List payment gateways                                                                                                                                                                                                   |

| `PAYMENT_REFUND`            | Refund payment                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| `PAYMENT_VOID`              | Void payment                                                                                                                                                                                                            |

To react to payment webhooks, first you need to create an app. You can follow as described in [this dashboard manual](/dashboard/apps.md) for regular app, or [read more](developer/extending/apps/key-concepts.mdx) about different app types.
Make sure to make the app active and grant it the `HANDLE_PAYMENTS` permission.

### Register `PAYMENT_LIST_GATEWAYS` webhook

When enabling payment webhooks, first you need to subscribe to the `PAYMENT_LIST_GATEWAYS` event. This event is called whenever Saleor is listing available payment gateways, either in API or internal use. This webhook needs to return information about payment methods that are defined in your app.

Below are two example cases when the `PAYMENT_LIST_GATEWAYS` event is triggered:

#### Listing all available payment gateways

This query returns information about available payment gateways without any additional context:

```graphql
{
  shop {
    availablePaymentGateways(currency: "USD", channel: "default-channel") {
      name
      id
      config {
        field
        value
      }
      currencies
    }
  }
}
```

The `availablePaymentGateways` field accepts the optional `currency` argument; if provided, it will be passed in the webhook payload and can be used to return payment methods that support a particular currency.

#### Listing available payment gateways for a checkout

You can also query for available payment gateways in the context of a specific checkout. This is useful if payment methods depend on the current checkout (e.g. user’s shipping country etc.)

```graphql
{
  checkout(token: "checkout-uuid-token") {
    availablePaymentGateways {
      name
    }
  }
}
```

See the example payload sent from Saleor for this event: [List payment gateways payload](/developer/extending/apps/sample-webhook-payloads.mdx#list-payment-gateways-payload).

#### Expected webhook response

In the response, you should return a list of supported payment methods, for example:

```json
[
   {
      "id":"credit-card",
      "name":"Credit Card",
      "currencies":[
         "EUR"
      ],
      "config":[]
   },
   {
      "id":"apple-pay",
      "name":"Apple Pay",
      "currencies":[
         "EUR",
         "USD"
      ],
      "config":[
         {
            "field":"apple-pay-config-field",
            "value":"value"
         }
      ]
   }
]
```

Each item on the list should have the following fields:
- `id` - ID of a payment method; must be unique within your app.
- `name` - the name of the payment method.
- `currencies` - list of currencies supported by this payment method.
- `config` - optional configuration, such as additional payment data that may be needed to proceed with the payment in the frontend.


### Register webhooks for payment actions

To subscribe to particular payment events (such as capture or authorization), you can have multiple webhooks with separate URLs for each action or a single webhook that handles all events (each webhook has an `Saleor-Event` header that contains the type of event).

List of payment events:

- `PAYMENT_AUTHORIZE`
- `PAYMENT_CAPTURE`
- `PAYMENT_CONFIRM`
- `PAYMENT_PROCESS`
- `PAYMENT_REFUND`
- `PAYMENT_VOID`

:::note
If an app has more than one webhook that listens to the same payment event, Saleor will always pick the first webhook from the list.
:::

See the example payload sent from Saleor for these payment events: [Payment actions payload](/developer/extending/apps/sample-webhook-payloads.mdx#payment-actions-payload).

For payments that require confirmation (such as 3D Secure) Saleor triggers events:
- `PAYMENT_PROCESS` - when the `checkoutComplete` mutation is run for the first time, payment is created and waiting for the user's confirmation.
- `PAYMENT_CONFIRM` - when the `checkoutComplete` mutation is run for the second time, payment is confirmed.
Depending on payment gateway, multiple events can be triggered.

For payments without a confirmation step, Saleor triggers only the `PAYMENT_PROCESS` event.

#### Expected response

Below is the list of fields that webhook can return in the JSON response for a payment action. All fields are optional:

- `action_required` - (boolean) determines if additional action (confirmation) is required.
- `action_required_data` - (object) additional data that may be needed to confirm the payment, for example, URL to redirect the user to the confirmation page in the frontend.
- `amount` - (number) transaction amount; use this field only if the charged amount is different than checkout's total.
- `customer_id` - (string) gateway's customer ID.
- `error` - (string) error message; if provided, the transaction will be marked as failed in Saleor and payment will have to be retried. Use this field if you need to return any errors.
- `payment_method` - (object) information about payment method chosen by the user.
- `psp_reference` - (string) external payment reference id. Can be used for finding transaction in payment provider dashboard or relevant order in Saleor dashboard.
- `transaction_id` - (string) gateway's transaction ID.
- `transaction_already_processed` - (boolean) use this field to mark a transaction as already processed in your gateway.

The response fields match with the `GatewayResponse` data class used in Saleor to represent a response from a payment gateway; you can read more about these fields [here](/developer/extending/payment-gateways.mdx#gatewayresponse).

Example response for the `PAYMENT_PROCESS` event when confirmation is required:

```json
{
   "action_required": true,
   "action_required_data":{"confirmation_url": "https://www.example.com/3ds-confirmation/"},
   "customer_id":"customer-1234",
   "payment_method": {
     "brand":"Visa",
     "exp_month":"01",
     "exp_year":"2025",
     "last_4":"4242",
     "name":"John Doe",
     "type":"Credit card",
   },
   "transaction_id":"transaction-1234"
}
```

### Use payment webhook's payment method in checkout

If payment webhooks are configured properly, you can use their payment methods in checkout. To do this, you need to [list available payment methods for your checkout or shop](/developer/extending/apps/key-concepts.mdx#listing-all-available-payment-gateways). Each payment method from a payment webhook has an ID of this format: `app:<app-database-id>:<id-returned-by-webhook>`

Example: `app:1:credit-card`

To use this gateway in checkout, run `checkoutPaymentCreate` mutation and pass this ID as the `gateway` parameter:

```graphql
mutation {
  checkoutPaymentCreate(
    checkoutId: "example-checkout-id"
    input: { gateway: "app:1:credit-card", amount: 22.36 }
  ) {
    payment {
      id
    }
  }
}
```

Running the `checkoutComplete` mutation afterward will use the payment method set above and trigger your payment webhook.

See more about checkout mutations [here](developer/checkout.mdx).


## Shipping webhooks

:::info

This feature was introduced in **Saleor 3.1**.

:::

:::caution

This feature is currently in **Feature Preview**. This part of Saleor is not complete
and subject to change but is available to experiment and provide feedback.

:::

Synchronous webhooks for shipping methods allow Saleor Apps to control shipping methods available for checkouts and draft orders.

### List external shipping methods

This solution can be used whenever shipping methods need to be fetched from a 3rd party API or the pricing logic built-it into Saleor is not sufficient for your needs.

External shipping methods can be either used alone or together with internal shipping methods. Saleor will return both the internal methods (defined through the Saleor Dashboard and stored in the `ShippingMethod` model) as well as external methods returned from the sync webhook.

#### Subscribe to the webhook

Saleor Apps can subscribe to the `SHIPPING_LIST_METHODS_FOR_CHECKOUT` synchronous webhook. It is called whenever
shipping methods are queried for a checkout object.

```graphql
{
  checkout(token: "checkout-uuid-token") {
    shippingMethods {
      id
      name
    }
  }
}
```

#### Request format

#### Response format

This is an example response from the application:

```json
[
  {
    "id": "method-1",
    "name": "Same Day Delivery",
    "amount": 10.0,
    "currency": "USD"
  },
  {
    "id": "method-2",
    "name": "Standard Delivery",
    "amount": 0.0,
    "currency": "USD",
    "maximum_delivery_days": 14
  }
]
```

#### Selecting shipping methods

External shipping methods have an ID of the following format: `app:<app-database-id>:<id-returned-by-webhook>`

They are be selected using the same mutations as internal shipping methods, e.g.

```graphql
mutation {
  checkoutDeliveryMethodUpdate (
    token: "915d9405-629f-4ef2-98f4-8480d5cf827f",
    deliveryMethodId: "YXBwOjEyMzQ6c29tZS1pZA==",
  ) {
    checkout {
      deliveryMethod {
        ... on ShippingMethod {
          id
          name
        }
      }
    }
    errors {
      code
      message
    }
  }
}
```

Information about an external shipping method is stored in order's private metadata. This entry should be kept
in order to allow the shipping method to be correctly displayed in the dashboard.

### Filter shipping methods



#### Subscribe to the webhook

Saleor Apps can subscribe to the synchronous webhooks:
- `CHECKOUT_FILTER_SHIPPING_METHODS` is called whenever shipping methods are listed for a checkout
- `ORDER_FILTER_SHIPPING_METHODS` is called whenever shipping methods are listed for an order

#### Request format

Example request for `CHECKOUT_FILTER_SHIPPING_METHODS`:

#### Implementation guide

`ShippingMethod` objects returned by `Checkout.shippingMethods` and `Order.shippingMethods` will have 2 attributes:
- `active` which is set to `false` when at least one of the Saleor Apps excludes the methods
- `message` which concatenates the exclusion reason coming from each of the apps

```graphql
{
  checkout(token: "checkout-uuid-token") {
    shippingMethods {
      id
      name
      active
      message
    }
  }
}
```

:::warning
Even though external methods are also subject to filtering, we recommend to integrate only one of the two approaches,
as every single synchronous webhook affects the response time of your Saleor API.
