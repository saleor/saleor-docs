This article focuses on developing apps connected to Saleor hosted in the cloud. You can also develop them locally, using Saleor Platform, without access to internet. Read more about [developing apps locally](developer/extending/apps/local-app-development.mdx)

## What is a tunnel, and why do you need one?

The Saleor extendability model relies on the concept of Apps. If you want to read more about them, head to [the Apps page](developer/extending/apps/index.mdx).

As you want Apps to react to events in your store, you reach for webhooks. However, webhooks pose a unique challenge: they can only communicate with public clients. If so, how are you supposed to develop your app on `localhost`?

This is where tunnels come into play. **A tunnel allows you to create a proxy that exposes a local environment to a public URL.**

Let's say you are building a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) application that leverages a webhook. You boot it up with the `next dev` command, which renders it on `http://localhost:3000`. Since this address is only reachable from your machine and is not HTTPS compliant, the webhook cannot reach the app. We have a perfect use case for a tunnel on our hands.

A simplified process of using a tunnel to expose this app would look like this:

1. Start the dev server of your application.
2. You authenticate yourself in the tunneling service of your choosing (e.g.: `ngrok`).
3. You provide the tunnel with the port number `3000` (where your app is running).
4. The tunnel will provide a publicly available URL of your application.
5. Now you can install your application in Saleor Cloud and receive webhooks ðŸŽ‰.

### Saleor App Tunnel

:::caution
We are keen on making Saleor App Tunnel flawless. Yet, issues with its stability may occur now and then. If that's the case, please look at [the alternatives](#alternatives).
:::

To use Saleor App Tunnel, you must install [Saleor CLI](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@saleor/cli):

```bash
npm i -g @saleor/cli
```

:::note
Run `saleor app tunnel --help` to check detailed usage, like changing the used port or automatic installation of the app.
:::

To create a tunnel, run `saleor app tunnel` inside the app directory. After several seconds, the CLI should print a URL with the`.saleor.live` domain:

```bash
$ saleor app tunnel

### Alternatives

While we encourage you to use Saleor App Tunnel, Saleor will work with any tunneling solution. They will all follow a set-up process similar to the Saleor App Tunnel.

## Installing the App in the Dashboard

An extra feature of the Saleor CLI is installing Apps inside the Dashboard. This way, you can develop the App while displaying it inside your Saleor Dashboard.

If your tunnel isn't already running, you can run the following command:

```bash
saleor app tunnel --force-install # sets up the tunnel and installs the app
```

If you have started the tunnel with a separate command, all you have to do is install it with:

```bash
saleor app install # installs the app
```
