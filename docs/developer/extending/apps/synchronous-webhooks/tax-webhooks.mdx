:::info
Subscription Webhook Payloads are available in Saleor 3.6.

:::caution
This feature is in the **Feature Preview** stage, which means that it is available for experimentation and
feedback. However, it is still undergoing development and is subject to modifications.

# Introduction

Tax webhooks are synchronous webhooks that allow delegating tax calculations to Saleor Apps. Synchronous means that these webhooks expect a response of a particular shape to be returned from the App to continue processing in Saleor. Tax webhooks only support the HTTP(S) protocol; they are sent as POST requests with the `application/json` body and expect a response of the same content type.

## Key concepts

The `HANDLE_TAXES` permission is required for the App to be able to calculate taxes. When there is more than one App subscribed to `CHECKOUT_CALCULATE_TAXES` or `ORDER_CALCULATE_TAXES`, we iterate over them until we get a proper response.
Prices on checkout and order are denormalized.

- Order prices

  Prices for orders never expire, but can be invalidated only in `draft order` or `unconfirmed order`. Prices are invalidated automatically for any address, user, line, and shipping change in orders.

- Checkout prices

  Prices for checkout can expire. The expiration time is set automatically when new taxes are fetched (regardless of the source tax). Expiration time can be set in the settings by the `CHECKOUT_PRICES_TTL` variable. Prices for checkouts can also be invalidated by any change to checkouts. This process is also automatic for any address, user, line, and shipping change in checkouts.

## Available taxes events

| Name                       | Description                   |
| -------------------------- | ----------------------------- |
| `CHECKOUT_CALCULATE_TAXES` | Calculates taxes for checkout |
| `ORDER_CALCULATE_TAXES`    | Calculates taxes for order    |

## Checkout taxes

Saleor Apps can subscribe to the `CHECKOUT_CALCULATE_TAXES` synchronous webhook. It is called whenever a user fetches checkout prices that are expired or not calculated yet. The response is processed and saved on checkout and checkout lines. Prices can expire or be invalidated by any change to checkout. Any tax App is treated as the source of truth about pricing.

:::note
For the amount fields, we use the same format as in the rest of the API.
For example, the amount of 12,34 USD will be sent as `"total_amount": "12.34"`
:::

:::warning

- All sales are included in line prices.
- Shipping vouchers are included in shipping prices.
- Vouchers for "Specific products" are included in line prices.
- Vouchers "Apply only to a single cheapest eligible product" are included in line prices.

### Request

The shape of the request payload can be customized by using subscription webhook payloads.
More details about using webhook with subscription can be found [here](developer/extending/apps/subscription-webhook-payloads.mdx#).

The below example shows a definition of a subscription query that defines the shape of the incoming payload.
Only basic fields were requested.

```graphql
subscription {
  event {
    __typename
    ... on CalculateTaxes {
      taxBase {
        lines {
          totalPrice {
            amount
          }
        }
        shippingPrice {
          amount
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

The payload sent to the app would look like this:

```json
{
  "taxBase": {
    "lines": [{ "totalPrice": { "amount": 28 } }],
    "shippingPrice": { "amount": 10 }
  },
  "__typename": "CalculateTaxes"
}
```
