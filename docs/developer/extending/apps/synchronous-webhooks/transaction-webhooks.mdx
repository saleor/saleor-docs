title: Transaction webhooks
---

# Introduction

:::caution
This feature is in the **Feature Preview** stage, which means that it is available for experimentation and
feedback. However, it is still undergoing development and is subject to modifications.
:::

Transaction webhooks are synchronous webhooks that allow delegating the transaction's action to the Saleor App.
Synchronous means that these webhooks expect a response of a particular shape to be returned from the App to continue processing in Saleor.
Transaction webhooks only support the HTTP(S) protocol; they are sent as POST requests with the `application/json` body and expect the
response of the same content type.

## Key concepts

The `HANDLE_PAYMENTS` permission is required for the App to receive transaction webhooks.
The webhook notification is only sent to a specific app connected to a given transaction.

The usage of the webhook is strictly related to the payment flow handled by transactions.
You can find more details about the transaction flow in the [_Payments_ documentation](../../../payments#saleor-app-recommended).

## Transaction charge

`TRANSACTION_CHARGE_REQUESTED`

:::info

This feature was introduced in **Saleor 3.13**.

:::

A synchronous webhook called inside a Celery task. It is triggered when a staff user requests the charge action.

The webhook expects to return at least the `pspReference` in the response. The `pspReference` will be attached to [TransactionEvent](api-reference/payments/objects/transaction-event.mdx)
with request details. When `pspReference` is attached to the `request` object, it means the app has successfully processed the webhook.

Optionally the result data can be provided. The data is
used to provide the final status of the requested action, and it will be used to create a new [TransactionEvent](api-reference/payments/objects/transaction-event.mdx)
object. The new [TransactionEvent](../../../../api-reference/payments/objects/transaction-event.mdx) object will have provided `pspReference`, and will be used in the
[recalculation of the transaction's amount process](../../../payments#re-calculations-of-transaction-amounts).

### Request

Saleor will send a
[TRANSACTION_CHARGE_REQUESTED](../../../../api-reference/webhooks/enums/webhook-event-type-sync-enum.mdx#code-style-fontweight-normal-webhookeventtypesyncenumbtransaction_charge_requestedbcode)
webhook by using the [TransactionChargeRequested](../../../../api-reference/payments/objects/transaction-charge-requested) subscription type or with a pre-defined payload in case of a missing subscription query.

You can find more details about building webhook subscription query
[here](../../../extending/apps/subscription-webhook-payloads).

The example below shows a sample webhook subscription defined to handle charge requests:

```graphql
subscription {
  event {
    __typename
    ... on TransactionChargeRequested {
      action {
        actionType
        amount
      }
      transaction {
        id
        pspReference
        authorizedAmount {
          amount
          currency
        }
        order {
          id
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

The example below shows the pre-defined payload that will be used in the case when a subscription query is not provided:

```json
{
  "action": { "currency": "USD", "type": "charge", "value": "5.00" },
  "meta": {
    "issued_at": "2022-06-28T10:50:00+00:00",
    "issuing_principal": { "id": "Sample app objects", "type": "app" },
    "version": "3.13.0-a"
  },
  "transaction": {
    "authorized_value": "10.00",
    "available_actions": ["capture", "void"],
    "canceled_value": "0.00",
    "charged_value": "0.00",
    "checkout_id": null,
    "created_at": "2022-06-28T10:50:00Z",
    "currency": "USD",
    "message": "",
    "modified_at": "2022-06-28T10:50:00Z",
    "name": "Credit card",
    "order_id": "T3JkZXI6YjE1YzdlZTgtMzUxNy00MTczLWEzNWYtMmQxMDdkMWI4Yzhk",
    "psp_reference": "PSP ref",
    "reference": "PSP ref",
    "refunded_value": "0.00",
    "status": "Authorized",
    "type": "Credit card",
    "voided_value": "0.00"
  }
}
```

### Response

#### Async flow

App needs to at least return the `pspReference` of the requested action. This is a common case
when the payment provider doesn't return a status of the requested action in the response.
In this situation, the status of the action is delivered by an asynchronous notification that
should be handled by App, and passed to Saleor by using the
[transactionEventReport](../../../payments#reporting-action-for-transaction)
mutation.

The response in this case should have the following structure:

```json
{
  "pspReference": "<psp reference received from payment provider>"
}
```

#### Sync flow

The app has the possibility to report the status of the requested action immediately.
This is a common case when the payment provider returns the status of the action in
response to the requested action.
The payload response has to contain at least `pspReference`, `result` (
[CHARGE_SUCCESS](../../../../api-reference/payments/enums/transaction-event-type-enum#code-style-fontweight-normal-transactioneventtypeenumbcharge_successbcode)
or [CHARGE_FAILURE](../../../../api-reference/payments/enums/transaction-event-type-enum#code-style-fontweight-normal-transactioneventtypeenumbcharge_failurebcode)),
and `amount` fields.

The response in this case should have the following structure:

```json
{
  "pspReference": "<psp reference recieved from payment provider>",
  "result": "<CHARGE_SUCCESS or CHARGE_FAILURE>",
  "amount": "<Decimal amount of the processed action>",
  "time": "<[Optional] time of the action>",
  "externalUrl": "<[Optional] external url with action details>",
  "message": "<[Optional] message related to the action>",
  "actions": "<[Optional] list of actions available for the transaction. Possible items: CHARGE, REFUND, CANCEL>"
}
```

:::caution
In the case when one of `result`, `amount` is provided and the second one is missing,
the response will not be processed, and Saleor will create the failure event.
:::

## Transaction cancelation

`TRANSACTION_CANCELATION_REQUESTED`

:::info

This feature was introduced in **Saleor 3.13**.

:::

A synchronous webhook called inside a Celery task. They are called when a staff user requests the cancelation action.
The webhook expects to return at least the `pspReference` in the response. The `pspReference` will
be attached to [TransactionEvent](api-reference/payments/objects/transaction-event.mdx)
with request details. When `pspReference` is attached to the `request` object, it means the app has successfully processed the webhook. Optionally the result data can be provided. The data is
used to provide the final status of the requested action, and it will be used to create a new
[TransactionEvent](api-reference/payments/objects/transaction-event.mdx) object. The new
[TransactionEvent](../../../../api-reference/payments/objects/transaction-event.mdx) object will have
provided `pspReference`, and will be used in the
[recalculation of the transaction's amount process](../../../payments#re-calculations-of-transaction-amounts).

### Request

Saleor will send a
[TRANSACTION_CANCEL_REQUESTED](../../../../api-reference/webhooks/enums/webhook-event-type-sync-enum.mdx#code-style-fontweight-normal-webhookeventtypesyncenumbtransaction_cancelation_requestedbcode)
webhook by using the [TransactionCancelationRequested](../../../../api-reference/payments/objects/transaction-cancelation-requested) subscription type or with a pre-defined payload in case of a missing subscription query.
You can find more details about building webhook subscription query
[here](../../../extending/apps/subscription-webhook-payloads).

The example below shows a sample webhook subscription defined to handle cancelation requests:

```graphql
subscription {
  event {
    __typename
    ... on TransactionCancelationRequested {
      action {
        actionType
        amount
      }
      transaction {
        id
        pspReference
        authorizedAmount {
          amount
          currency
        }
        order {
          id
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

The example below shows the pre-defined payload that will be used in the case when a subscription query is not provided:

```json
{
  "action": { "currency": "USD", "type": "cancel", "value": "0.00" },
  "meta": {
    "issued_at": "2022-06-28T10:50:00+00:00",

## Transaction refund

`TRANSACTION_REFUND_REQUESTED`

:::info

This feature was introduced in **Saleor 3.13**.

:::

A synchronous webhook called inside a Celery task. They are called when a staff user requests the refund action.
The webhook expects to return at least the `pspReference` in the response. The `pspReference` will be attached to [TransactionEvent](api-reference/payments/objects/transaction-event.mdx)
with request details. When `pspReference` is attached to the `request` object, it means the app has successfully processed the webhook. Optionally the result data can be provided. The data is
used to provide the final status of the requested action, and it will be used to create a new [TransactionEvent](api-reference/payments/objects/transaction-event.mdx)

[recalculation of the transaction's amount process](../../../payments#re-calculations-of-transaction-amounts).

### Request

Saleor will send a
[TRANSACTION_REFUND_REQUESTED](../../../../api-reference/webhooks/enums/webhook-event-type-sync-enum.mdx#code-style-fontweight-normal-webhookeventtypesyncenumbtransaction_refund_requestedbcode)
webhook by using the [TransactionRefundRequested](../../../../api-reference/payments/objects/transaction-refund-requested) subscription type or with a pre-defined payload in case of a missing subscription query.

More details about building webhook subscription query can be found
[here](../../../extending/apps/subscription-webhook-payloads).

The example below shows a sample webhook subscription defined to handle refund requests:

```graphql
subscription {
  event {
    __typename
    ... on TransactionRefundRequested {
      action {
        actionType
        amount
      }
      transaction {

### Response

The app needs to return the `data` field. The `data` received from the webhook will be returned as a [paymentGatewayInitialize](developer/payments.mdx#initialize-payment-gateway) mutation response.

```json
{
  "data": {
    "some": "init-data"
  }
}
```

## Initialize transaction session

`TRANSACTION_INITIALIZE_SESSION`
:::info

This feature was introduced in **Saleor 3.13**.

:::

The synchronous [TRANSACTION_INITIALIZE_SESSION](api-reference/webhooks/enums/webhook-event-type-sync-enum.mdx#code-style-fontweight-normal-webhookeventtypesyncenumbtransaction_initialize_sessionbcode) webhook
is called when a customer begins processing a payment by calling the [transactionInitialize](developer/payments.mdx#initialize-transaction)
mutation. The webhook contains details about the object (`Order`/`Checkout`) related to this action, the `transactionItem` object, details related to the
requested action, and the `data` passed in the mutation input. Saleor expects the response to be in the proper format. Based on the response, the `transactionItem`'s amount can be marked as fully covered
or marked as a transaction that requires additional actions from the customer, such as processing 3D secure action.

### Request

Saleor will send a
[TRANSACTION_INITIALIZE_SESSION](api-reference/webhooks/enums/webhook-event-type-sync-enum.mdx#code-style-fontweight-normal-webhookeventtypesyncenumbtransaction_initialize_sessionbcode)
webhook by using the [TransactionInitializeSession](api-reference/payments/objects/transaction-initialize-session.mdx) subscription type or with a pre-defined payload in case of a missing subscription query.

More details about building webhook subscription query can be found
[here](../../../extending/apps/subscription-webhook-payloads).

        actionType
      }
      transaction {
        id
      }
    }
  }
}
```

The example below shows the pre-defined payload that will be used in the case when a subscription query is not provided:

```json
{
  "id": "Q2hlY2tvdXQ6Mjk2OWFkNTAtZTQwYS00ZThkLTgwNWItYjk5ZDI0ZGYwOTdm",

  "transaction_id": "VHJhbnNhY3Rpb25JdGVtOjNiZDUyNjQ2LTUxM2YtNGE1Ni1hOWUzLWY3NzEwN2Y2NTAxNA=="
}
```

### Response

The app must return a response in a specified format. Based on the payload, Saleor will determine the current status of the transaction.
If the format is incorrect or the response is missing, Saleor will create either a `CHARGE_FAILURE` or `AUTHORIZATION_FAILURE` event, depending on the type of action that was requested.

The response in this case should have the following structure:

```json
{
  "pspReference": "<psp reference recieved from payment provider>",
  "result": "CHARGE_SUCCESS or CHARGE_FAILURE or CHARGE_REQUEST or AUTHORIZATION_SUCCESS or AUTHORIZATION_FAILURE or AUTHORIZATION_REQUEST or AUTHORIZATION_ACTION_REQUIRED or CHARGE_ACTION_REQUIRED>",
  "amount": "<Decimal amount of the processed action>",
  "data": "<[Optional] JSON data tha will be returned to storefront>",
  "time": "<[Optional] time of the action>",
  "externalUrl": "<[Optional] external url with action details.",
  "message": "<[Optional] message related to the action>",
  "actions": "<[Optional] list of actions available for the transaction. Possible items: CHARGE, REFUND, CANCEL>"
}
```

Below are the possible `result` values and their explanations:

- `result:CHARGE_SUCCESS`: The funds have been successfully charged. The event amount will be added to `transaction.chargedAmount`.
- `result:AUTHORIZATION_SUCCESS`: The funds have been successfully authorized. The event amount will be added to `transaction.authorizedAmount`.
- `result:CHARGE_REQUEST`: A charge has been requested. The event amount will be added to `transaction.chargePendingAmount`.
- `result:AUTHORIZATION_REQUEST`: An authorization has been requested. The event amount will be added to `transaction.authorizePendingAmount`.
- `result:AUTHORIZATION_ACTION_REQUIRED`: Additional actions are required from the customer to authorize the payment. Before finalizing these additional actions, the payment is treated as not processed.
- `result:CHARGE_ACTION_REQUIRED`: Additional actions are required from the customer to charge the payment. Before finalizing these additional actions, the payment is treated as not processed.
- `result:CHARGE_FAILURE`: Charging the payment has failed.
- `result:AUTHORIZATION_FAILURE`: Authorizing the payment has failed.

## Process transaction session

`TRANSACTION_PROCESS_SESSION`
:::info

This feature was introduced in **Saleor 3.13**.

:::

The [TRANSACTION_PROCESS_SESSION](api-reference/webhooks/enums/webhook-event-type-sync-enum.mdx#code-style-fontweight-normal-webhookeventtypesyncenumbtransaction_process_sessionbcode) webhook is called synchronously when
a customer needs to process additional actions received as a response from either
the [transactionInitialize](developer/payments.mdx#initialize-transaction) or [transactionProcess](/developer/payments.mdx#process-transaction) mutations. This webhook is triggered when the customer calls the
[transactionProcess](/developer/payments.mdx#process-transaction) mutation.
It contains details about the `Order` or `Checkout` object related to this action, the `transactionItem` object, details related to the requested action, and the `data` passed in the mutation input.
Saleor expects the response to be in the proper format. Based on the response, the amount of the `transactionItem` can be marked as fully covered or marked as a transaction
that requires additional actions from the customer, such as processing a 3D secure action.

### Request

Saleor will send a
[TRANSACTION_PROCESS_SESSION](api-reference/webhooks/enums/webhook-event-type-sync-enum.mdx#code-style-fontweight-normal-webhookeventtypesyncenumbtransaction_process_sessionbcode)
webhook by using the [TransactionProcessSession](/api-reference/payments/objects/transaction-process-session.mdx) subscription type or with a pre-defined payload in case of a missing subscription query.

[here](../../../extending/apps/subscription-webhook-payloads).

The example below shows a sample webhook subscription defined to handle transaction process requests:

```graphql
subscription TransactionProcess {
  event {
    ... on TransactionProcessSession {
      sourceObject {
        __typename
        ... on Checkout {
          id
          totalPrice {
            gross {
              amount
            }
          }
        }
        ... on Order {
          id
          total {
            gross {
              amount
            }
          }
        }
      }
      data
      merchantReference
      action {
        amount
        currency
        actionType
      }
      transaction {
        id
      }
    }
  }
}
```

The example below shows the pre-defined payload that will be used in the case when a subscription query is not provided:

```json
{
  "id": "Q2hlY2tvdXQ6NzMyNGJlMWMtMjg3Yy00NDQxLTkwOWYtMDhmYjg0YjNhYjNl",
  "data": {
    "some": "request-data"
  },
  "amount": "10.00",
  "currency": "USD",
  "action_type": "CHARGE",
  "transaction_id": "VHJhbnNhY3Rpb25JdGVtOjRhODMxNThkLTU0NTAtNDU2Mi04MDE5LTAzYzY4NjMyZjA1Mg=="
}
```

### Response

The app must return a response in a specified format. Based on the payload, Saleor will determine the current status of the transaction.
If the format is incorrect or the response is missing, Saleor will create either a `CHARGE_FAILURE` or `AUTHORIZATION_FAILURE` event, depending on the type of action that was requested.

The response in this case should have the following structure:

```json
{
  "pspReference": "<psp reference recieved from payment provider>",
  "result": "CHARGE_SUCCESS or CHARGE_FAILURE or CHARGE_REQUEST or AUTHORIZATION_SUCCESS or AUTHORIZATION_FAILURE or AUTHORIZATION_REQUEST or AUTHORIZATION_ACTION_REQUIRED or CHARGE_ACTION_REQUIRED>",
  "amount": "<Decimal amount of the processed action>",
  "data": "<[Optional] JSON data tha will be returned to storefront>",
  "time": "<[Optional] time of the action>",
  "externalUrl": "<[Optional] external url with action details.",
  "message": "<[Optional] message related to the action>",
  "actions": "<[Optional] list of actions available for the transaction. Possible items: CHARGE, REFUND, CANCEL>"
}
```

Below are the possible `result` values and their explanations:

- `result:CHARGE_SUCCESS`: The funds have been successfully charged. The event amount will be added to `transaction.chargedAmount`.
- `result:AUTHORIZATION_SUCCESS`: The funds have been successfully authorized. The event amount will be added to `transaction.authorizedAmount`.
- `result:CHARGE_REQUEST`: A charge has been requested. The event amount will be added to `transaction.chargePendingAmount`.
- `result:AUTHORIZATION_REQUEST`: An authorization has been requested. The event amount will be added to `transaction.authorizePendingAmount`.
- `result:AUTHORIZATION_ACTION_REQUIRED`: Additional actions are required from the customer to authorize the payment. Before finalizing these additional actions, the payment is treated as not processed.
- `result:CHARGE_ACTION_REQUIRED`: Additional actions are required from the customer to charge the payment. Before finalizing these additional actions, the payment is treated as not processed.
- `result:CHARGE_FAILURE`: Charging the payment has failed.
- `result:AUTHORIZATION_FAILURE`: Authorizing the payment has failed.
