## Introduction

Saleor arrives with some plugins already implemented by default. These plugins are located in `saleor.extensions.plugins`.
To provide the `ExtensionManager` with a list of enabled plugins, include the Python plugin path in the `settings.PLUGINS` list.

## Extension manager

The `ExtensionsManager` is located in the `saleor.extensions.manager`. It is a class responsible for handling all declared plugins and serving a response from them. In case of a non-declared plugin, it serves a default response.

It is possible to overwrite an `ExtensionsManager` class by implementing it on its own. Saleor will discover the manager class by taking the declared path from `settings.EXTENSIONS_MANAGER`.

## Base plugin class

The `BasePlugin` class is located in the `saleor.extensions.base_plugin`.It serves as an abstract class for storing all callback methods available to plugins.

Multiple plugins are executed as a pipeline: each callback receives a `previous_value` parameter, the first plugin receives the default value, each consecutive plugin receives the output of the previous one.

## Configuration

Saleor allows you to change the configuration of any given plugin over API.

`CONFIG_STRUCTURE` describes the *shape* of the configuration: field names, their types, and labels to use in the user interface.

`DEFAULT_CONFIGURATION` provides initial values for those fields.

The plugin configuration can be further validated by overwriting the `validate_plugin_configuration` method like in the following example:

```python
# custom_tax/plugin.py

from django.core.exceptions import ValidationError
from saleor.extensions import ConfigurationTypeField
from saleor.extensions.base_plugin import BasePlugin


class TaxApiPlugin(BasePlugin):
    PLUGIN_NAME = "Tax API"
    CONFIG_STRUCTURE = {
        "login": {
            "type": ConfigurationTypeField.STRING,
            "help_text": "Provide your login name",
            "label": "Username or account",
        },
        "password": {
            "type": ConfigurationTypeField.STRING,
            "help_text": "Provide your password or API token",
            "label": "Password",
        }
    }
    DEFAULT_CONFIGURATION = [
        {"name": "login", "value": None},
        {"name": "password", "value": None},
    ]

    @classmethod
    def validate_plugin_configuration(cls, plugin_configuration: "PluginConfiguration"):
        """Validate if provided configuration is correct."""
        missing_fields = []
        configuration = plugin_configuration.configuration
        configuration = {item["name"]: item["value"] for item in configuration}
        if not configuration["login"]:
            missing_fields.append("username or account")
        if not configuration["password"]:
            missing_fields.append("password or API token")

        if plugin_configuration.active and missing_fields:
            error_msg = (
                "To enable a plugin, you need to provide values for the "
                "following fields: "
            )
            raise ValidationError(error_msg + ", ".join(missing_fields))
```

Saleor will use this data to create default configuration in DB which will be served by the API.

## Writing your own plugins

Make sure that each plugin inherits from the `BasePlugin` class and that it overwrites base methods.
You can write your plugin as a class which has callable instances, like the one below:

```python
# custom/plugin.py

from django.conf import settings
from urllib.parse import urljoin

from ...base_plugin import BasePlugin
from .tasks import api_post_request_task


class CustomPlugin(BasePlugin):
    def postprocess_order_creation(self, order: "Order", previous_value: Any):
        data = ...

        transaction_url = urljoin(settings.CUSTOM_API_URL, "transactions/createoradjust")
        api_post_request_task.delay(transaction_url, data)
```

:::note
There is no need to implement all base methods as the `ExtensionManager` will use default values for methods that are not implemented.
:::

### Loading your plugin

To activate the new plugin, add it to the `settings.PLUGINS` list in your Django settings:

```python
# settings.py

PLUGINS = ["saleor.extensions.plugins.custom.CustomPlugin", ]
```

### Background tasks

Some plugin operations should be done asynchronously. Saleor uses Celery and will discover all Celery tasks declared in `tasks.py` in the plugin directories.

```python
# custom_plugin/plugin.py

class MyPlugin(BasePlugin):
    def postprocess_order_creation(self, order: "Order", previous_value: Any):
        data = {}
        transaction_url = urljoin(get_api_url(), "transactions/createoradjust")

        api_post_request_task.delay(transaction_url, data)
```

```python
# custom_plugin/tasks.py

import json
from celery import shared_task
from typing import Any, Dict

import requests
from requests.auth import HTTPBasicAuth
from django.conf import settings


@shared_task
def api_post_request(
    url: str,
    data: Dict[str, Any],
):
    try:
        username = "username"
        password = "password"
        auth = HTTPBasicAuth(username, password)
        requests.post(url, auth=auth, data=json.dumps(data), timeout=settings.TIMEOUT)
    except requests.exceptions.RequestException:
        return
```
