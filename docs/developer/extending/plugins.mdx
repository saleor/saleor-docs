title: Plugins
---

## Introduction

Plugins offer a mechanism to extend Saleor's Python core with new functionality. They are loaded by the core process and use predefined callbacks to execute custom code in response to certain events.

Saleor ships with some plugins included, you can find those in the `saleor/plugins/` and `saleor/payment/gateways/` directories of the core.

## Built-in plugins

By default Saleor installs with the following plugins:

- *saleor.plugins.avatax.plugin.AvataxPlugin*
- *saleor.plugins.vatlayer.plugin.VatlayerPlugin*
- *saleor.plugins.webhook.plugin.WebhookPlugin*
- *saleor.plugins.invoicing.plugin.InvoicingPlugin*
- *saleor.payment.gateways.dummy.plugin.DummyGatewayPlugin*
- *saleor.payment.gateways.dummy_credit_card.plugin.DummyCreditCardGatewayPlugin*
- *saleor.payment.gateways.stripe.plugin.StripeGatewayPlugin*
- *saleor.payment.gateways.braintree.plugin.BraintreeGatewayPlugin*
- *saleor.payment.gateways.razorpay.plugin.RazorpayGatewayPlugin*
- *saleor.payment.gateways.adyen.plugin.AdyenGatewayPlugin*
- *saleor.payment.gateways.authorize_net.plugin.AuthorizeNetGatewayPlugin*


## Base plugin class

The `BasePlugin` class is located in the `saleor.plugins.base_plugin`. It's an abstract class implementing the entire API of callback methods available to plugins.

Multiple plugins are executed as a pipeline. Each callback receives a `previous_value` parameter: the first plugin receives the default value, each consecutive plugin receives the value returned by the previous one.

## Configuration

Saleor allows you to change the configuration of any given plugin over API.

`CONFIG_STRUCTURE` describes the *shape* of the configuration: field names, their types, and labels to use in the user interface.

`DEFAULT_CONFIGURATION` provides initial values for those fields.

The plugin configuration can be further validated by overwriting the `validate_plugin_configuration` method like in the following example:

```python
# custom_tax/plugin.py

from django.core.exceptions import ValidationError
from saleor.plugins.base_plugin import BasePlugin, ConfigurationTypeField


class TaxApiPlugin(BasePlugin):

    PLUGIN_ID = "plugin.taxapi"  # plugin identifier
    PLUGIN_NAME = "Tax API"  # display name of plugin
    PLUGIN_DESCRIPTION = "Description of the plugin."
    CONFIG_STRUCTURE = {
        "login": {
            "type": ConfigurationTypeField.STRING,
            "help_text": "Provide your login name",
            "label": "Username or account",
        },
        "password": {
            "type": ConfigurationTypeField.STRING,
            "help_text": "Provide your password or API token",
            "label": "Password",
        }
    }
    DEFAULT_CONFIGURATION = [
        {"name": "login", "value": None},
        {"name": "password", "value": None},
    ]
    DEFAULT_ACTIVE = False

    @classmethod
    def validate_plugin_configuration(cls, plugin_configuration: "PluginConfiguration"):
        """Validate if provided configuration is correct."""
        missing_fields = []
        configuration = plugin_configuration.configuration
        configuration = {item["name"]: item["value"] for item in configuration}
        if not configuration["login"]:
            missing_fields.append("username or account")
        if not configuration["password"]:
            missing_fields.append("password or API token")

        if plugin_configuration.active and missing_fields:
            error_msg = (
                "To enable a plugin, you need to provide values for the "
                "following fields: "
            )
            raise ValidationError(error_msg + ", ".join(missing_fields))
```

Saleor will use this data to create default configuration in DB which will be served by the API.

## Writing a new plugin

Make sure that each plugin inherits from the `BasePlugin` class and that it overwrites base methods.
You can write your plugin as a class which has callable instances, like the one below:

```python
# custom/plugin.py

from django.conf import settings
from urllib.parse import urljoin

from ..base_plugin import BasePlugin
from .tasks import api_post_request_task


class CustomPlugin(BasePlugin):
    def postprocess_order_creation(self, order: "Order", previous_value: Any):
        data = ...

        transaction_url = urljoin(settings.CUSTOM_API_URL, "transactions/createoradjust")
        api_post_request_task.delay(transaction_url, data)
```

:::note
There is no need to implement all base methods as the `PluginsManager` will use default values for methods that are not implemented.
:::

### Loading your plugin

Saleor uses the *entry points* API of Python's `setuptools` to automatically discover installed plugins. To make a plugin discoverable, include a `saleor.plugins` entry point in your `setup()` call. The syntax is `package_name = package_name.path.to:PluginClass`:

```python
# setup.py
from setuptools import setup

setup(
    ...,
    entry_points={
        "saleor.plugins": [
            "my_plugin = my_plugin.plugin:MyPlugin"
        ]
    }
)
```

If your plugin is a Django app, the package name (the part before the equal sign) will be added to Django's `INSTALLED_APPS` so you can take advantage of Django's features such as ORM integration and database migrations.

### Background tasks

Some plugin operations should be done asynchronously. Saleor uses Celery and will discover all Celery tasks declared in `tasks.py` in the plugin directories.

```python
# custom_plugin/plugin.py

class MyPlugin(BasePlugin):
    def postprocess_order_creation(self, order: "Order", previous_value: Any):
        data = {}
        transaction_url = urljoin(get_api_url(), "transactions/createoradjust")

        api_post_request_task.delay(transaction_url, data)
```

```python
# custom_plugin/tasks.py

import json
from celery import shared_task
from typing import Any, Dict

import requests
from requests.auth import HTTPBasicAuth
from django.conf import settings


@shared_task
def api_post_request(
    url: str,
    data: Dict[str, Any],
):
    try:
        username = "username"
        password = "password"
        auth = HTTPBasicAuth(username, password)
        requests.post(url, auth=auth, data=json.dumps(data), timeout=settings.TIMEOUT)
    except requests.exceptions.RequestException:
        return
```
### Webhook handler

The `BasePlugin` has an abstract method `webhook`. The `webhook` method can be used for processing the payload received over HTTP. It is useful in case when a plugin can receive the data from the external services, like payment gateway or external notification system.

```python
# custom_plugin/plugin.py

class MyPlugin(BasePlugin):
    PLUGIN_ID = "my.plugin"
    def webhook(self, request: WSGIRequest, path: str, previous_value) -> HttpResponse:
        # check if plugin is active
        # check signatures and headers.
        if path == '/webhook/paid`:
            # do something with the request
            return JsonResponse(data={"paid":True})
        return HttpResponseNotFound()
        
```

The above method will be called when we execute the request to `www.your.saleor.com/plugins/my.plugin/webhook/paid`.

`PluginManager` will identify the owner of the request and will pass the data to the expected plugin. Everything in the URL path after the `PLUGIN_ID`(my.plugin) will be passed to the plugin as a `path` argument. 

:::note
Plugin as a response needs to return the object of type inherited from `django.http.HttpResponse`.
:::


## Customizing the plugins manager

The `PluginsManager` class is located in the `saleor.plugins.manager` module. It is a class responsible for handling all declared plugins and serving a response from them. Unless further customized this class is used to interface with the plugins. Should you need to use a custom sub-class (or an entirely new implementation), you can tell Saleor to use it by setting `settings.PLUGIN_MANAGER` to the Python path of your custom implementation.
