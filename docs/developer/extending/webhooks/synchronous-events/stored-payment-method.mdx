title: Stored payment method events

# Introduction

:::caution
This feature is in the **Feature Preview** stage, which means that it is available for experimentation and
feedback. However, it is still undergoing development and is subject to modifications.
:::

A stored payment method is a payment method that can be used later by customers without providing all payment details.
Saleor has synchronous webhooks that allow delegating the stored payment methods management to payment apps.

## Key concepts

The `HANDLE_PAYMENTS` permission is required for the App to receive store payment method webhooks.

The usage of the webhook is strictly related to the usage of stored payment method.
You can find more details about it in the [_Stored Payment Methods_](../../../payments#stored-payment-methods).

:::info

This feature is dedicated to [third-party](api-reference/apps/enums/app-type-enum.mdx#code-style-fontweight-normal-apptypeenumbthirdpartybcode) apps.

## List stored payment methods

`LIST_STORED_PAYMENT_METHODS`

:::info

This feature was introduced in **Saleor 3.15**.

:::

A synchronous webhook is called when the user wants to fetch stored payment methods. Triggered when a
customer requested a field [User.storedPaymentMethod](api-storefront/users/objects/user.mdx#code-style-fontweight-normal-userbstoredpaymentmethodsbcodestoredpaymentmethod--), [checkout.storedPaymentMethods](api-storefront/checkout/objects/checkout.mdx#code-style-fontweight-normal-checkoutbstoredpaymentmethodsbcodestoredpaymentmethod--).

The webhook expects to return a list of payment methods that are assigned to the customer. The payment
methods from the webhook response will be returned as a response for [User.storedPaymentMethod](api-storefront/users/objects/user.mdx#code-style-fontweight-normal-userbstoredpaymentmethodsbcodestoredpaymentmethod--), [checkout.storedPaymentMethods](api-storefront/checkout/objects/checkout.mdx#code-style-fontweight-normal-checkoutbstoredpaymentmethodsbcodestoredpaymentmethod--) fields.

:::info

To reduce the number of HTTP requests triggered to the payment app, the response is cached on
Saleor side. Saleor will trigger a new request when the cache expires or becomes invalid.

:::

### Request

Saleor will send a
[LIST_STORED_PAYMENT_METHODS](api-reference/webhooks/enums/webhook-event-type-sync-enum.mdx#code-style-fontweight-normal-webhookeventtypesyncenumblist_stored_payment_methodsbcode)
webhook by using the [ListStoredPaymentMethods](api-reference/payments/objects/list-stored-payment-methods.mdx) subscription type or with a pre-defined payload in case of a missing subscription query.

You can find more details about building webhook subscription query
[here](../../../extending/webhooks/subscription-webhook-payloads).

The example below shows a sample webhook subscription defined to list stored payment methods:

```graphql
subscription {
  event {
    ... on ListStoredPaymentMethods {
      user {
        id
      }
      channel {
        id
      }
    }
  }
}
```

The example below shows the pre-defined payload that will be used in the case when a subscription query is not provided:

```json
{
  "user_id": "VXNlcjoyOA==",
  "channel_slug": "main"
}
```

### Response

The app needs to return a list of stored payment methods that can be used by customer.

The response in this case should have the following structure:

```json
{
  "paymentMethods": [
    {
      "id": "<ID of stored payment method>",
      "supportedPaymentFlows": "<list of supported flows that can be performed with this payment method>",
      "type": "<type of the payment method. For example: Credit Card>",
      // "creditCardInfo": [Optional] credit card information if the payment method is a credit card.
      "creditCardInfo": {
        "brand": "<credit card brand>",
        "lastDigits": "<last digits>",
        "expMonth": "<expiration month>",
        "expYear": "<expiration year>",
        "firstDigits": "<[Optional] first digits>"
      },
      "name": "<[Optional] name of the payment method. For example: last 4 digits of credit card, obfuscated email>",
      "data": "<[Optional] JSON data that will be returned to storefront>"
    }
  ]
}
```

Below are the possible `supportedPaymentFlows` values and their explanations:

- `INTERACTIVE` - Payment method can be used for 1 click checkout - it's prefilled in checkout
  form (might require additional authentication from user).
