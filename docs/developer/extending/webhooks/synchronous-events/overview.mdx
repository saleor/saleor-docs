## Introduction

Synchronous events refer to events or actions that are executed immediately within the same request/response cycle of the application. These events are typically triggered as part of the execution of a specific operation or workflow and are processed synchronously before the response is returned to the client.

:::warning
Using webhooks for synchronous events will affect Saleor API response time. If used extensively, it can cause a **significant performance impact** on response times! Make sure that the App server can keep up with customers' requests.
:::

These webhooks are run from the Saleor Core instance during GraphQL requests. As a result, the response data is sent to the client.

### Examples of the use cases

- payment events -> payment processing
- shipment events -> shipping calculation
- tax events -> tax calculation
- transaction events

## Permissions

Managing webhooks is available for users with the `MANAGE_APPS` permission. The App can also create and modify its own webhooks without the need for additional permissions.

## Webhook protocol

Synchronous webhooks support only HTTP(S).

Webhook payloads are sent in POST requests with the `application/json` body and expect the response of the same content type.

## Available Webhook events

The Synchronous can be grouped into the following categories:

- [Payment events](./payment.mdx): allow delegating payment handling to Saleor Apps
- [Shipping events](./shipping.mdx): allow Saleor Apps to control shipping methods available for checkouts and draft orders.
- [Tax events](./tax.mdx): allow delegating tax calculations to Saleor Apps.
- [Transaction events](./transaction.mdx): allow delegating the transaction's action to Saleor App.
- [Stored payment method events](./stored-payment-method.mdx): allow delegating the management of stored payment method to Saleor App.

The [WebhookEventTypeSyncEnum](../../../../api-reference/webhooks/enums/webhook-event-type-sync-enum#values) represents the latest list of synchronous webhooks.
