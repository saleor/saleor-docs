## Interacting with transactions

You can interact with transactions via your backend to build any type of payment flow, automation or business logic you wish using CRUD operation, see [Transaction API](/developer/payments/transactions.mdx).

Use case examples:

- Automate refund logic
- Recurring subscription logic
- Custom payment flow, where **your backend** works directly with **your frontend** and only writes orders and payments to Saleor without using Saleor's checkout and payment APIs.

## Existing payment integrations

Payment integrations are front-end friendly APIs that allow you to process payments without the need to interact with payment providers directly without a backend. In this setup, Saleor [acts as a middleware](/developer/payments/payment-apps.mdx#processing-payments-with-the-payment-app) between your frontend and the payment app which talks to payment provider.

The vendor team and partners have a larger collection of payment integrations, which would eventually be documented. Currently, Saleor provides guides for the following:

<CardGrid>
    [**Adyen guide** Advance enterprise ready integration](/developer/app-store/apps/adyen/overview.mdx)

    [**Stripe guide** Basic payment flow including refunds.](/developer/app-store/plugins/stripe.mdx)

</CardGrid>

If you wish to use a different payment provider, please contact [our team](mailto:hello@saleor.io).

## Custom payment integrations

There are two main approaches (or mix of both) to build custom payment integrations:

### Saleor as middleware

Using [Saleor as middleware](/developer/payments/payment-apps.mdx) to communicate between **your storefront** and **your payment apps**.
This approach provides the following advantages:

- A generic interface for interacting with apps, making them interchangeable. For example, your Stripe and Paypal integrations can be swapped without changing your storefront.
- Front-end developers or other microservices will not need to interact with your payment logic directly, which simplifies documentation and the need for additional endpoints.

### Your backend

Your own backend that interacts with payment providers and your storefront. [Transaction API](/developer/payments/transactions.mdx) is only used to update `Transactions` in `Orders`. This way, you can create any logic or flow you wish, but it will cost more ownership.
