[`Order.paymentStatus`](api-reference/orders/objects/order.mdx#orderpaymentstatuspaymentchargestatusenum---) represents the combined payment and refund status of the order. It's calculated based on:

- `order.total` value
- status of the payments
- refunds granted for the order

When [no refunds](/developer/payments/refunds.mdx) are created, the status is one of the following:

- `PENDING`: waiting for the response from the payment gateway
- `REFUSED`: payment refused by the payment gateway
- `CANCELLED`: payment has been canceled
- `NOT_CHARGED`: the amount is authorized but not charged
- `PARTIALLY_CHARGED`: the charged amount does not cover the order total
- `FULLY_CHARGED`: charged funds fully cover the order total

Creating the refund will change the status to:

- `PARTIALLY_REFUNDED`: the refunded amount does not cover the order total
- `FULLY_REFUNDED`: refunded funds fully cover the order total

:::tip
`Checkout` doesn't have `paymentStatus` field, instead you can use `authorizeStatus` and `chargeStatus` described below to check status of transactions.

```

#### Authorization status calculation for Order

[`Order.authorizeStatus`](/api-reference/orders/objects/order#orderauthorizestatusorderauthorizestatusenum---) status depends on:

- sum of **charged** transactions
- sum of **authorized** transactions
- `order.totalGrantedRefund` value
- `order.total` value

The difference between [`total`](/api-reference/orders/objects/order.mdx#ordertotaltaxedmoney---) and [`totalGrantedRefund`](/api-reference/orders/objects/order.mdx#ordertotalgrantedrefundmoney---) is compared with the sum of **charged** and **authorized** transactions. The result is one of the statuses: `PARTIAL`, `FULL`. If no transaction has been authorized, the status is `NONE`.

#### Authorization status calculation for Checkout

The status is calculated based on all `TransactionItem`s assigned to the `Checkout`. 

For a checkout, authorization means that funds have been either authorized or charged (or a combination of partially charged and partially authorized).
The status takes into account the following fields: `authorizedAmount`, `chargedAmount`, `authorizePendingAmount`, and `chargePendingAmount`:

- **NONE**: No funds have been authorized.
- **PARTIAL**: The available funds do not fully cover the checkout's total amount.
- **FULL**: The funds fully cover the checkout's total amount. At this point, `checkoutComplete` can be called to convert the checkout into an order. 

:::caution
Note that pending amounts (success or failure) will be confirmed later by the payment app. This means the system can create an order that may remain unpaid if the pending amounts eventually fail.
:::

#### Available transitions

- Status is updated when Checkout's `totalAmount` is changed.
- Status is updated when Checkout's `TransactionItem`'s amounts are updated.

#### Authorization status calculation for Order

The status is calculated based on all transactions assigned to the `Order`.
Authorization means that funds have been either fully or partially authorized or charged.
It uses the fields `authorizedAmount` and `chargedAmount`, and the calculation is adjusted by subtracting `order.totalGrantedRefund` from the total.

:::caution
Unlike checkout, this status does not consider pending amounts.
:::

- **NONE**: No funds have been authorized.
- **PARTIAL**: The authorized and charged funds do not fully cover the amount of `order.total - order.totalGrantedRefund`.
- **FULL**: The authorized and charged funds fully cover the amount of `order.total - order.totalGrantedRefund`.

#### Available transitions

- Status is updated when Order's `totalAmount` is changed.
- Status is updated when Order's `TransactionItem`'s amounts are updated.
- Status is updated when `Order.grantedRefunds` are updated.

### Charge status

 NONE --> PARTIAL
 NONE --> FULL
 NONE --> OVERCHARGED

 PARTIAL --> FULL
 PARTIAL --> OVERCHARGED
 OVERCHARGED --> FULL
 OVERCHARGED --> PARTIAL


 FULL --> OVERCHARGED
 FULL --> PARTIAL
```

Charge status depends on:

- the sum of **charged** transactions
- the `order.totalGrantedRefund` value
- the `order.total` value

The difference between `total` and `totalGrantedRefund` is compared with **charged** transactions, and the result is one of the statuses: `PARTIAL`, `FULL`, `OVERCHARGED`. If no transaction has been charged, the status is `NONE`.

#### Charge status calculations for Checkout

The status is calculated based on all transactions assigned to the checkout.
It takes into account the fields: `chargedAmount` and `chargePendingAmount`.

- **NONE**: No funds have been charged.
- **PARTIAL**: The charged funds do not fully cover the checkout's total amount.
- **FULL**: The charged funds fully cover the checkout's total. At this point,
the `CHECKOUT_FULLY_PAID` webhook event is sent, and `checkoutComplete` can be called
to convert the checkout into an order.
- **OVERCHARGED**: The charged funds exceed the checkout's total. In this case,
the `CHECKOUT_FULLY_PAID` webhook event is sent as well, and `checkoutComplete`
can still be called to convert the checkout into an order.

:::caution
When the checkout `chargeStatus` is either `FULL` or `OVERCHARGED`, the `authorizeStatus`
also changes to `FULL`, allowing the checkout to be completed.
However, any pending amounts (whether successful or failed) will be confirmed later
by the payment application. This means that even though the order is created,
it may still remain unpaid if the pending amounts fail to process.
:::

#### Available transitions

- Status is updated when Checkout's `totalAmount` is changed.
- Status is updated when Checkout's `TransactionItem`'s amounts are updated.

#### Charge status calculations for Order

The status is calculated based on all transactions assigned to the order.
It uses the field `chargedAmount` and does not consider **pending amounts** (which differs from the charge status of the checkout).
The amount used for the status calculation is reduced by `order.totalGrantedRefund`.

- **NONE**: No funds have been charged.
- **PARTIAL**: The charged funds do not fully cover the amount of `order.total - order.totalGrantedRefund`.
- **FULL**: The charged funds fully cover the amount of `order.total - order.totalGrantedRefund`.
- **OVERCHARGED**: The charged funds exceed the amount of `order.total - order.totalGrantedRefund`.

#### Available transitions

- Status is updated when Order's `totalAmount` is changed.
- Status is updated when Order's `TransactionItem`'s amounts are updated.
- Status is updated when `Order.grantedRefunds` are updated.

## Transactions recalculation of amounts

The recalculation will differ based on the value of the [`TransactionEventTypeEnum`](/api-reference/payments/enums/transaction-event-type-enum.mdx) provided as the field `type`
used in the `transactionEventReport`, `transactionInitialize` and `transactionProcess` mutations, or [optionally in the webhook response](/developer/extending/webhooks/synchronous-events/transaction.mdx):

### Examples

The tables below show examples of transactions and their amounts when a given event is attached to the transaction.
Depending on the event type, the amounts may change. The last columns show the current amounts assigned to the transaction after
processing the events defined in a given row and in the rows above it.

| Event |         Type          | pspReference |           Time            | Amount | `transaction.authorizedAmount` | `transaction.authorizePendingAmount` |
| :---: | :-------------------: | :----------: | :-----------------------: | :----: | :----------------------------: | :----------------------------------: |
|   1   | AUTHORIZATION_REQUEST |     AB12     | 2022-03-28T12:50:33+00:00 |   10   |               0                |                  10                  |
|   2   | AUTHORIZATION_SUCCESS |     AB12     | 2022-03-28T12:51:33+00:00 |   10   |               10               |                  0                   |
|   3   | AUTHORIZATION_FAILURE |     YZ13     | 2022-03-28T12:52:33+00:00 |   10   |               10               |                  0                   |

After receiving an `AUTHORIZATION_REQUEST` event, the amount defined in the event is attached to `transaction.authorizePendingAmount`.
Then, an `AUTHORIZATION_SUCCESS` event is attached to the transaction. Since the `AUTHORIZATION_SUCCESS` event has the same `pspReference` as
the `AUTHORIZATION_REQUEST` event, the `transaction.authorizePendingAmount` is reduced by the event amount, and added to the `transaction.authorizedAmount`.
An `AUTHORIZATION_FAILURE` event doesn’t change anything, as there isn’t an `AUTHORIZATION_REQUEST` event related to it.

---

| Event |           Type           | pspReference |           Time            | Amount | `transaction.authorizedAmount` | `transaction.authorizePendingAmount` |
| :---: | :----------------------: | :----------: | :-----------------------: | :----: | :----------------------------: | :----------------------------------: |
|   1   |  AUTHORIZATION_REQUEST   |     AB12     | 2022-03-28T12:50:33+00:00 |   10   |               0                |                  10                  |
|   2   |  AUTHORIZATION_SUCCESS   |     AB12     | 2022-03-28T12:51:33+00:00 |   10   |               10               |                  0                   |
|   3   | AUTHORIZATION_ADJUSTMENT |     YZ13     | 2022-03-28T12:52:33+00:00 |  100   |              100               |                  0                   |

Upon receiving an `AUTHORIZATION_REQUEST` event, the corresponding amount is attached to `transaction.authorizePendingAmount`. An `AUTHORIZATION_SUCCESS` event
is then attached to the transaction, with the same `pspReference` as the `AUTHORIZATION_REQUEST` event. The `transaction.authorizePendingAmount` is reduced
by the event amount, and the result is added to the `transaction.authorizedAmount`.
Note that an `AUTHORIZATION_ADJUSTMENT` event will overwrite the previous `transaction.authorizedAmount` and cause the
previous `AUTHORIZATION_SUCCESS` event to be ignored.

---

| Event |         Type          | pspReference |           Time            | Amount | `transaction.authorizedAmount` | `transaction.authorizePendingAmount` |
| :---: | :-------------------: | :----------: | :-----------------------: | :----: | :----------------------------: | :----------------------------------: |
|   1   | AUTHORIZATION_SUCCESS |     AB12     | 2022-03-28T12:51:33+00:00 |   10   |               10               |                  0                   |

---

The transaction receives an `AUTHORIZATION_SUCCESS` event. Since there is no `AUTHORIZATION_REQUEST` with the same pspReference, the value of `transaction.authorizePendingAmount`
will not be changed. The amount from the event is assigned to `transaction.authorizedAmount`.

| Event |         Type          | pspReference |           Time            | Amount | `transaction.chargedAmount` | `transaction.chargePendingAmount` | `transaction.authorizedAmount` |

|   2   |    CHARGE_REQUEST     |     YZ13     | 2022-03-28T12:51:33+00:00 |   3    |              0              |                 3                 |               7                |
|   3   |    CHARGE_SUCCESS     |     YZ13     | 2022-03-28T12:52:33+00:00 |   3    |              3              |                 0                 |               7                |

When the transaction receives an `AUTHORIZATION_SUCCESS` event, if there is no `AUTHORIZATION_REQUEST` with the same pspReference, the value of `transaction.authorizePendingAmount`
will not change. The amount from the event is then assigned to `transaction.authorizedAmount`. Additionally, a `CHARGE_REQUEST` event is added to the transaction, and the amount
from the event is added to `transaction.chargePendingAmount`. The amount also reduces `transaction.authorizedAmount`. Finally, when a `CHARGE_SUCCESS` event occurs, the `transaction.chargePendingAmount`
is reduced by the event’s amount and added to `transaction.chargedAmount`.

When an `AUTHORIZATION_SUCCESS` event is attached to the transaction, the `transaction.authorizedAmount` is updated with the amount from the event.
If there is no `AUTHORIZATION_REQUEST` with the same `pspReference`, the `transaction.authorizePendingAmount` remains unchanged.
Additionally, a `CHARGE_REQUEST` event is added to the transaction, and its amount is added to `transaction.chargePendingAmount`.
The `transaction.authorizedAmount` is reduced by the amount from the `CHARGE_REQUEST` event.
Finally, when a `CHARGE_SUCCESS` event occurs, the `transaction.chargedAmount` is updated with the event's amount, and the
`transaction.chargePendingAmount` is reduced by the same amount. A `CHARGE_FAILURE` event with the same `pspReference` as `CHARGE_SUCCESS` is
also attached to the transaction, `time` indicating that it is newer than the `CHARGE_SUCCESS`. The previous `CHARGE_SUCCESS` event is ignored during the recalculation process.

When an `AUTHORIZATION_SUCCESS` event is attached to a transaction, the `transaction.authorizedAmount` is updated with the event's amount. If there is no `AUTHORIZATION_REQUEST` with the
same `pspReference`, the `transaction.authorizePendingAmount` remains unchanged. In addition, a `CHARGE_REQUEST` event is added to the transaction, and its amount is added to
`transaction.chargePendingAmount`. The `transaction.authorizedAmount` is reduced by the amount from the `CHARGE_REQUEST` event. Finally, when a `CHARGE_SUCCESS` event occurs, the
`transaction.chargedAmount` is updated with the event's amount, and the `transaction.chargePendingAmount` is reduced by the same amount. A `CHARGE_FAILURE` event with
the same `pspReference` as `CHARGE_SUCCESS` is also attached to the transaction. The `time` field indicates that it is older than the `CHARGE_SUCCESS` event. This means
that the `CHARGE_FAILURE` event will be ignored, and the `CHARGE_SUCCESS` event will be included in the calculations.

The `AUTHORIZATION_SUCCESS` event is attached to the transaction, and its amount is added to `transaction.authorizedAmount`. Similarly, the `CHARGE_SUCCESS` event is attached to the transaction,
and its amount is added to `transaction.chargedAmount`. Finally, the amount of the `AUTHORIZATION_SUCCESS` event is subtracted from the `transaction.authorizedAmount`.

## Transaction event types

### Authorization events

#### `AUTHORIZATION_SUCCESS`

Saleor assigns provided `amount` to `transaction.authorizedAmount`. If an `AUTHORIZATION_SUCCESS` event is related to an `AUTHORIZATION_REQUEST` event by `pspReference`, then the `transactionItem.authorizePendingAmount`
will be reduced by the amount reported in the `AUTHORIZATION_SUCCESS` event.
You can’t have two successful authorizations for a single transaction.
Each successful request after the first one will raise an exception. `AUTHORIZATION_ADJUSTMENT` should be used to change the `transaction.authorizedAmount`.

:::info

In the case of finding `AUTHORIZATION_SUCCESS` and `AUTHORIZATION_FAILURE` with the same `pspReference`,
the recalculation for `transaction.authorizedAmount` will not take into account the amount from
`AUTHORIZATION_SUCCESS`, when `AUTHORIZATION_SUCCESS` is the older one.

:::

#### `AUTHORIZATION_FAILURE`

If an `AUTHORIZATION_FAILURE` event is related to an `AUTHORIZATION_REQUEST` event by `pspReference`, then the `transactionItem.authorizePendingAmount`
will be reduced by the amount reported in the `AUTHORIZATION_FAILURE` event. If there is no related `AUTHORIZATION_REQUEST`, the failure event will only
be used to provide the history of `transactionItem` actions.

#### `AUTHORIZATION_ADJUSTMENT`

Saleor assigns the provided `amount` to the `transaction.authorizedAmount`.

### Charge events

#### `CHARGE_SUCCESS`

Adds the provided `amount` to the `transaction.chargedAmount`. Each next call will add the `amount` to the existing
`transaction.chargedAmount` (`transaction.chargedAmount += amount`). If a `CHARGE_SUCCESS` event is related to a `CHARGE_REQUEST` event by `pspReference`, then the `transactionItem.chargePendingAmount`
will be reduced by the amount reported in the `CHARGE_SUCCESS` event. If there is no related `CHARGE_REQUEST` event, the provided `amount` will reduce `transaction.authorizedAmount`.

:::info
In the case of finding `CHARGE_SUCCESS` and `CHARGE_FAILURE` with the same `pspReference`, the recalculation
for `transaction.chargedAmount` will not take into account the amount from `CHARGE_SUCCESS`, when
`CHARGE_SUCCESS` is the older one.
:::

#### `CHARGE_FAILURE`

If an `CHARGE_FAILURE` event is related to an `CHARGE_REQUEST` event by `pspReference`, then the `transactionItem.chargePendingAmount`
will be reduced by the amount reported in the `CHARGE_FAILURE` event. If there is no related `CHARGE_REQUEST`, the failure event will only
be used to provide the history of `transactionItem` actions.

#### `CHARGE_BACK`

The provided `amount` will be used to reduce `transaction.chargedAmount`
(`transaction.chargedAmount -= amount`).

### Refund events

:::warning
Refund events should only be triggered if the transaction has been previously charged.
Triggering a refund for uncharged transactions can lead to negative `chargedAmount`.
Refund events modify both the `refundedAmount` and `chargedAmount` values, so if the transaction wasn’t charged beforehand, it may result in data inconsistencies.
:::

#### `REFUND_SUCCESS`

Adds provided `amount` to `transaction.refundedAmount`. Each next call will add the `amount` to the existing
`transaction.refundedAmount` (`transaction.refundedAmount += amount`). If a `REFUND_SUCCESS` event is related to a `REFUND_REQUEST` event by `pspReference`, then the `transactionItem.refundPendingAmount`
will be reduced by the amount reported in the `REFUND_SUCCESS` event. If there is no related `REFUND_REQUEST` event, the provided `amount` will reduce `transaction.chargedAmount`.

:::info
In the case of finding `REFUND_SUCCESS` and `REFUND_FAILURE` with the same `pspReference`, the recalculation
for `transaction.refundedAmount` will not take into account the amount from `REFUND_SUCCESS`, when
`REFUND_SUCCESS` is the older one.

#### `REFUND_FAILURE`

If an `REFUND_FAILURE` event is related to an `REFUND_REQUEST` event by `pspReference`, then the `transactionItem.refundPendingAmount`
will be reduced by the amount reported in the `REFUND_FAILURE` event. If there is no related `REFUND_REQUEST`, the failure event will only
be used to provide the history of `transactionItem` actions.

#### `REFUND_REVERSE`

The provided `amount` will be used to reduce `transaction.refundedAmount` (`transaction.refundedAmount -= amount`).
The provided `amount` will increase `transaction.chargedAmount`.

### Cancel events

:::warning
Cancel events should only be triggered if the transaction has been previously authorized.
Triggering a cancel for transactions that didn't have any `authorizedAmount` can lead to negative `authorizedAmount`.
Cancel events modify both the `canceledAmount` and `authorizedAmount` values, so if the transaction wasn’t authorized beforehand, it may result in data inconsistencies.
:::

#### `CANCEL_SUCCESS`

The provided `amount` will be added to `transaction.canceledAmount`
(`transaction.canceledAmount += amount`). If a `CANCEL_SUCCESS` event is related to a `CANCEL_REQUEST` event by `pspReference`, then the `transactionItem.cancelPendingAmount`
will be reduced by the amount reported in the `CANCEL_SUCCESS` event. If there is no related `CANCEL_REQUEST` event, the provided `amount` will reduce `transaction.authorizedAmount`.

:::info
In the case of finding `CANCEL_SUCCESS` and `CANCEL_FAILURE` with the same `pspReference`, the recalculation
for `transaction.canceledAmount` will not take into account the amount from `CANCEL_SUCCESS`, when
`CANCEL_SUCCESS` is the older one.
:::

#### `CANCEL_FAILURE`

If an `CANCEL_FAILURE` event is related to an `CANCEL_REQUEST` event by `pspReference`, then the `transactionItem.cancelPendingAmount`
will be reduced by the amount reported in the `CANCEL_FAILURE` event. If there is no related `CANCEL_REQUEST`, the failure event will only
be used to provide the history of `transactionItem` actions.


## Transaction event flow

Transaction events modify the amount fields, which define the state of the transaction.
We do not require any specific order of incoming events, the transaction amounts will be calculated
based on the rules described [above](#transaction-event-types).
But to maintain accuracy and integrity, it is important that events are triggered in a valid order.
The chart below illustrates the possible sequence of events that can follow one another.
Failure to adhere to these guidelines may result in negative values and data inconsistencies.
