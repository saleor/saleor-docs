title: Refunds
---

There are two ways to process refunds:

- Manual refund: This method involves directly refunding the payment through the payment app.
- Refund based on `OrderGrantedRefund`: This method triggers the refund request based on the details stored in `OrderGrantedRefund`.

## Manual refund

The manual refund can be triggered by calling `transactionRequestAction`. If the refund is successful, the `transaction.chargedAmount` will be reduced. The order's `authorizeStatus`, `chargeStatus`, and `totalBalance` will also be recalculated based on the new values of `chargedAmount` and `refundedAmount`. This method is useful when handling overcharged orders.

The below example shows how to trigger the manual refund:

```graphql {3-5}
mutation {
  transactionRequestAction(
    id: "VHJhbnNhY3Rpb25JdGVtOjljY2NkYTYyLTllMjktNGE0OC05NzIyLWRlYzAwOTRmZmY5Yg=="
    actionType: REFUND
    amount: "10"
  ) {
    transaction {
      events {
        id
        message
        pspReference
        amount {
          amount
        }
        type
      }
    }
  }
}
```

The mutation accepts below arguments:

- `id` - ID of the transaction which will be used to trigger the refund action.
- `actionType` - The type of action to be performed on the requested `TransactionItem`. For a refund action, use `REFUND`.
- `amount` - The amount of the action. The amount is rounded based on the given currency precision. If not provided Saleor will use `TransactionItem.chargedAmount`.

## Grant refunds

A granted refund refers to the process where a customer receives their money back after a refund request has been approved.
Once a refund is granted, the customer is reimbursed for the purchase.

When processing a refund based on `OrderGrantedRefund`, there are two steps involved. Firstly, an order must be granted a refund, which defines what should be refunded. This step requires the `MANAGE_ORDERS` permission. Secondly, a refund needs to be requested based on the created `OrderGrantedRefund`. This step requires the `HANDLE_PAYMENTS` permission.

A granted refund contains all the details related to the refund, such as the list of refunded lines, the amount, and the included shipping costs. This is useful when handling refunds based on the products returned by the customer.

The current status of the `OrderGrantedRefund` is represented by the `status` field. The possible statuses are:

- `NONE`: No refund request has been triggered for the granted refund.
- `PENDING`: The refund request has been triggered, but the payment app has not provided the final result.
- `SUCCESS`: The refund has been successfully processed.
- `FAILURE`: The last refund request failed.

The `status` is calculated based on the latest refund `TransactionEvent`s assigned to the `OrderGrantedRefund`. The events can be accessed via the `OrderGrantedRefund.transactionEvents` field. The assigned `TransactionItem` can be accessed via the `OrderGrantedRefund.transaction` field.

The `OrderGrantedRefund` has an impact on the `authorizeStatus`, `chargeStatus`, and `totalBalance`, as it reduces the total value used to calculate the `totalBalance`.

:::note
The maximum `amount` of `OrderGrantedRefund` is the `order.total`.
:::

For example:

- if an order has a total of 100 USD and a single `TransactionItem` with a `chargedAmount` of 100 USD, the `totalBalance` would be 0, as `chargedAmount` - `order.total` results in 0<sup>(1)</sup>.
- Adding a granted refund with an amount of 10 USD would result in a `totalBalance` of 10, as `chargedAmount` - (`order.total` - `grantedRefund.amount`) gives 10. The `chargeStatus` will be `OVERCHARGED`<sup>(2)</sup>.
- If a refund request is made based on the defined granted refund and is successfully processed by the payment app, it will reduce the `chargedAmount`. The `totalBalance` will be 0, as `chargedAmount` (90USD) - (`order.total` - `grantedRefund.amount`) gives 0. The `chargeStatus` will be changed to `FULL`<sup>(3)</sup>.

| Step Nr | total | totalBalance | authorizeStatus | chargeStatus | tr.chargedAmount | orderGrantedRefund.amount |
| ------- | ----- | ------------ | --------------- | ------------ | ---------------- | ------------------------- |
| 1       | 100   | 0            | FULL            | FULL         | 100              | 0                         |
| 2       | 100   | 10           | FULL            | OVERCHARGED  | 100              | 10                        |
| 3       | 100   | 0            | FULL            | FULL         | 90               | 10                        |

The following example shows how to create the granted refund with the assigned `TransactionItem` for the order.

```graphql {3-19}
mutation {
  orderGrantRefundCreate(
    id: "T3JkZXI6NWZlOTE5NzItYjg3OC00Y2QyLTkyN2UtZTQwZDJjZDRjMmEz"
    input: {
      transactionId: "VHJhbnNhY3Rpb25JdGVtOmUzOTVjNzdmLWFmNjQtNDRmZC05NmRiLThkZmNkMDYwNmZmOA=="
      lines: [
        {
          id: "T3JkZXJMaW5lOjdlNzg5NzY0LTUyZWMtNDU3Mi05NWNkLTM5ZjQ0OTJmZDk4ZA=="
          quantity: 5
          reason: "Line reason"
        }
        {
          id: "T3JkZXJMaW5lOjdlNzg5NzY0LTUyZWMtNDU3Mi05NWNkLTM5ZjQ0OTJmZDk4Z1=="
          quantity: 5
        }
      ]
      grantRefundForShipping: true
      amount: 10
      reason: "Returned by customer"
    }
  ) {
    grantedRefund {
      id
    }
    order {
      id
    }
    errors {
      field
      code
      message
      lines {
        lineId
        field
        message
        code
      }
    }
  }
}
```

The mutation accepts below arguments:

- `id` - ID of the `Order` to which granted refund should be assigned.
- `input`:
- `lines` - List of lines related to the planned refund action:
- `id` - ID of the `OrderLine`.
- `quantity` - The quantity of the specific lines planned to refund.
- `reason` - Reason of the refund related to the specific line.
- `grantRefundForShipping` - Determines if the shipping costs will be also included in the refund.
- `amount` - Amount of the granted refund. If not provided, the amount will be calculated automatically based on provided `lines` and `grantRefundForShipping`.
- `transactionId` - ID of `TransactionItem` that will be used to process the refund. If `amount` is provided in the input, the `transaction.chargedAmount` needs to be equal to or greater than the provided `amount`. If `amount` is not provided in the input and calculated automatically by Saleor, the `min(calculatedAmount, transaction.chargedAmount)` will be used. This field was added in Saleor 3.20, and it will be a mandatory input field starting from Saleor 3.21.

The below example shows how to update the existing granted refund

```graphql {3-15}
mutation {
  orderGrantRefundUpdate(
    id: "T3JkZXJHcmFudGVkUmVmdW5kOjE="
    input: {
      addLines: [
        {
          id: "T3JkZXJMaW5lOjgzYmZmZWI3LTVkNjEtNDMzZS1iOGFkLTFhMTE1NWI2ZTgwNg=="
          quantity: 3
        }
      ]
      removeLines: []
      transactionId: "VHJhbnNhY3Rpb25JdGVtOmUzOTVjNzdmLWFmNjQtNDRmZC05NmRiLThkZmNkMDYwNmZmOA=="
      amount: 10
      grantRefundForShipping: false
      reason: "New reason"
    }
  ) {
    grantedRefund {
      id
    }
    errors {
      addLines {
        field
        message
        code
        lineId
      }
      field
      code
    }
  }
}
```

The mutation accepts below arguments:

- `id` - ID of the `OrderGrantedRefund` which should be updated
- `input`:
- `addLines`: Lines that should be added to `OrderGrantedRefund`
- `id` - ID of the `OrderLine`.
- `quantity` - The quantity of the specific lines planned to refund.
- `reason` - Reason for the planned refund related to the specific line.
- `removeLines` - List of `OrderGrantedRefundLine`'s IDs that should be removed from `OrderGrantedRefund`.
- `grantRefundForShipping` - Determines if the shipping costs will be also included in the refund.
- `amount` - Amount of the granted refund. If not provided, the amount will be calculated automatically based on provided `lines` and `grantRefundForShipping`.
- `transactionId` - ID of `TransactionItem` that will be used to process the refund. If `amount` is provided in the input, the `transaction.chargedAmount` needs to be equal to or greater than the provided `amount`. If `amount` is not provided in the input and calculated automatically by Saleor, the `min(calculatedAmount, transaction.chargedAmount)` will be used. This field was added in Saleor 3.20, and it will be a mandatory input field starting from Saleor 3.21.

Below example shows how to trigger the refund based on `OrderGrantedRefund`:

```graphql {2}
mutation {
  transactionRequestRefundForGrantedRefund(
    grantedRefundId: "T3JkZXJHcmFudGVkUmVmdW5kOjE="
  ) {
    transaction {
      id
    }
    errors {
      field
      message
      code
    }
  }
}
```

To request a refund, you need to provide the `grantedRefundId` field. The mandatory refund details are stored as `OrderGrantedRefund`, so the refund request will be created based on this data.
The `OrderGrantedRefund.status` field will be updated based on the result of the refund action. The `TransactionEvent`s related to the requested action will be accessible via `OrderGrantedRefund.transactionEvents` field.

### Total remaining grant calculations

The amount specified in the `OrderGrantedRefund` determines the portion of the `order.total` that should be refunded to the customer.
The `order.totalRemainingGrant` specifies the amount that still needs to be refunded
to achieve a state where the total charged amount equals the `order.total` minus the granted refund amount.

The `order.totalRemainingGrant` amount is calculated based on the following formula:

```Python
totalRemainingGrant = totalGrantedRefund - alreadyGrantedRefund
```

where

- `alreadyGrantedRefund` is the difference between already refunded and overcharged amounts
  ```python
  alreadyGrantedRefund = max((totalRefunded - overchargedAmount), 0)
  ```
- `totalGrantedRefund` is a sum of all `amount` from all `OrderGrantedRefund`. The maximum value is `order.total`, when the value is above,
  it's replaced with the `order.total`.
  ```python
  totalGrantedRefund = max(sum(orderTotalGranted.amount), order.total)
  ```
- `totalRefunded` is a sum of `amount` from all transactions with refunded or pending refunds amount
  ```python
  totalRefunded = sum(amountRefunded + amountRefundPending)
  ```
- `overchargedAmount` defines the `amount` that has been charged over the `order.total` value. It's calculated
  as a sum of all processed amounts (excluding cancel amounts) minus the `order.total`.

  ```python
  processedAmount = sum(amountCharged + amountRefunded + amountAuthorized + amountChargePending + amountRefundPending + amountAuthorizePending)

  overchargedAmount = processedAmount - order.total
  ```

Below is an example order with multiple transactions and `totalRemainingGrant` at each stage:

1. An order has a total of 100 USD and two `TransactionItem`s: one with a `chargedAmount` of 100 USD and the second with `chargedAmount` of 60 USD.
   The `totalBalance` would be 60, as `chargedAmount` - `order.total` results in 60, and we do not have any granted refunds. The `chargeStatus` is `OVERCHARGED`.
2. Adding a granted refund of 10 USD increases the `totalBalance` to 70, as it widens the difference between the total charged amount and the new expected order total.
   Here's the calculation:
   ```python
   totalBalance = totalCharged - (order.total - totalGrantedRefunds) = 160 - (100 - 10) = 70
   ```
   The `totalRemainingGrant` becomes 10, as the `totalRefundedAmount` is 0.
3. The second transaction is refunded for an amount of 50 USD.
   After this operation, the `totalBalance` is 20, and the order remains `OVERCHARGED`. The `totalChargedAmount` decreases, and the `totalRefundedAmount` increases.
   The `totalRemainingGrant` remains 10 because the `overchargedAmount` still exceeds the original order.total.

   ```python
   overchargedAmount = totalChargedAmount + totalRefundedAmount - order.total = 110 + 50 - 100 = 60

   totalRefunded = max(totalGrantedRefund - (totalRefunded - overchargedAmount), 0) = max(10 - max(50 - 60, 0)) = 10 - 0 = 10
   ```

4. In the next step the first transaction was refunded for 15 USD. This brings the total below the `order.total` value, reducing the `totalRemainingGrant`.
5. Finally, the last refund of 5 USD is processed, resulting in a `totalBalance` of 0. The `chargeStatus` is `FULL`, and the `totalRemainingGrant` is 0.

| Step Nr | total | totalBalance | authorizeStatus | chargeStatus | totalChargedAmount | totalRefundedAmount | orderGrantedRefund.amount | totalRemainingGrant.amount |
| ------- | ----- | ------------ | --------------- | ------------ | ------------------ | ------------------- | ------------------------- | -------------------------- |
| 1       | 100   | 60           | FULL            | OVERCHARGED  | 160                | 0                   | 0                         | 0                          |
| 2       | 100   | 70           | FULL            | OVERCHARGED  | 160                | 0                   | 10                        | 10                         |
| 3       | 100   | 20           | FULL            | OVERCHARGED  | 110                | 50                  | 10                        | 10                         |
| 4       | 100   | 5            | FULL            | OVERCHARGED  | 95                 | 65                  | 10                        | 5                          |
| 5       | 100   | 0            | FULL            | FULL         | 90                 | 70                  | 10                        | 0                          |

> **Note:**
>
> - `totalChargedAmount` - is the sum of charged amounts from all transactions
> - `totalRefundedAmount` - is the sum of all refunded or pending refunds amount from all transactions

:::info
**In case of calculating total remaining grant:**

- Pending amounts are treated as they were processed, so are included in all processed amounts.
  It also means that `totalChargedAmount` includes `amountChargePending`, and `totalRefundedAmount` includes `amountRefundPending`.
- Authorized amounts, including `amountAuthorized` and `amountAuthorizePending`, are also considered processed. These amounts will contribute to the overall processed totals and impact the `overchargedAmount`.
