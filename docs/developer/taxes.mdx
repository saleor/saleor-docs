title: Taxes
---

Saleor offers two ways of calculating taxes: flat rates and dynamic taxes.

Flat rates allow you to configure static tax rates per country and channel, and assign them to products via tax classes. Dynamic taxes, on the other hand, enable you to delegate tax calculations to 3rd-party tax providers like Avalara, TaxJar, or entirely custom tax apps.

You can configure the tax calculation method per channel and override the configuration for different countries.

## Tax Configuration

The tax configuration object defines various configuration options for a channel. This includes the tax calculation method, whether to charge taxes in the channel, or whether the entered prices include the tax. The configuration object is created automatically for each sales channel. In the API, it is represented by the [`TaxConfiguration`](api-reference/taxes/objects/tax-configuration.mdx) object.

The tax configuration object has several properties, including:

- `chargeTaxes` - Determines whether taxes are charged in the channel. If enabled, taxes are calculated and customers pay the gross prices. If disabled, taxes are still calculated and available for display, but customers pay the net prices.
- `taxCalculationStrategy` - The strategy for tax calculation in the channel. There are two strategies available:
  - flat rates - the default strategy
  - dynamic taxes (tax apps)
- `useWeightedTaxForShipping` - Determines whether to use weighted tax for shipping. When set to true, the tax rate for shipping will be calculated based on the weighted average of tax rates from the order or checkout lines. Default value is `false`. Can be used only with `taxCalculationStrategy` set to `FLAT_RATES`. Available from 3.21.
- `displayGrossPrices` - Determines whether prices displayed in a storefront should include taxes. Note that this setting doesn’t affect internal calculations in Saleor, and it’s only meant for the storefront to decide if it should display `TaxedMoney.net` or `TaxedMoney.gross` price (see [TaxedMoney API reference](api-reference/miscellaneous/objects/taxed-money.mdx)). For storefront queries, this property can be fetched at two levels:
  - product level in the [ProductPricingInfo.displayGrossPrices](api-reference/products/objects/product-pricing-info.mdx) field - use it when rendering product listings or product details pages
  - checkout level in the [Checkout.displayGrossPrices](api-reference/checkout/objects/checkout.mdx) field - use it when rendering the cart or checkout pages
- `pricesEnteredWithTax` - Determine whether product prices are entered with tax included (typical for B2C in EU) or not (typical for US and B2B).
- `taxAppId` - Specify which Tax App should be responsible for tax calculation when tax apps are used as a calculation strategy.

  You can query all the available tax apps with:

  ```graphql
  query GetShop {
    shop {
      availableTaxApps {
        id
        name
        identifier
      }
    }
  }
  ```

  where `identifier` is the value you should use to set the `taxAppId` in the `taxConfigurationUpdate` mutation.

  Besides tax apps, you can assign plugins to `taxAppId`. To assign a plugin, you need to provide the value in the following format: `plugin:PLUGIN_ID`. Please note that plugins will be deprecated.

Additionally, the following properties can be overridden for specific countries within the channel: `chargeTaxes`, `taxCalculationStrategy`, `displayGrossPrices` and `taxAppId`. This allows for handling various situations where a store operates in different countries with different tax rules.

### Fetching tax configurations

Below are some common API examples of retrieving and managing the tax configuration. To fetch the list of tax configurations with their properties, use the following query:

```graphql
query TaxConfigurations {
  taxConfigurations(first: 10) {
    edges {
      node {
        id
        channel {
          slug
        }
        chargeTaxes
        displayGrossPrices
        pricesEnteredWithTax
        taxCalculationStrategy
        taxAppId
      }
    }
  }
}
```

To query a specific tax configuration by ID, use the query below (in this case, we’re only asking for the `taxCalculationStrategy` field):

```graphql
query TaxConfiguration {
  taxConfiguration(id: "VGF4Q29uZmlndXJhdGlvbjox") {
    taxCalculationStrategy
  }
}
```

### Updating the tax configuration

The `taxConfigurationUpdate` mutation allows you to update the specific tax configuration. The example below shows how to set the tax calculation strategy to dynamic taxes (in API represented as the `TAX_APP` option):

```graphql
mutation {
  taxConfigurationUpdate(
    id: "VGF4Q29uZmlndXJhdGlvbjox"
    input: { taxCalculationStrategy: TAX_APP }
  ) {
    errors {
      field
      message
    }
    taxConfiguration {
      taxCalculationStrategy
    }
  }
}
```

### Overriding tax configuration per country

Tax configurations specific to a channel can be modified for different countries. For example, a single sales channel may use flat rates for EU countries but use the tax app for the US. To represent this scenario in Saleor, you would set flat rates as the channel's default tax calculation strategy and override the configuration for the US to use dynamic taxes.

```graphql
mutation {
  taxConfigurationUpdate(
    id: "VGF4Q29uZmlndXJhdGlvbjox"
    input: {
      taxCalculationStrategy: FLAT_RATES
      updateCountriesConfiguration: [
        {
          countryCode: US
          taxCalculationStrategy: TAX_APP
          displayGrossPrices: false
          chargeTaxes: true
        }
      ]
    }
  ) {
    errors {
      field
      message
    }
    taxConfiguration {
      taxCalculationStrategy
      countries {
        country {
          code
        }
        chargeTaxes
        taxCalculationStrategy
        displayGrossPrices
      }
    }
  }
}
```

To remove the country-specific configuration, use the `removeCountriesConfiguration` field and provide the country code for which to remove the configuration:

```graphql
mutation {
  taxConfigurationUpdate(
    id: "VGF4Q29uZmlndXJhdGlvbjox"
    input: { removeCountriesConfiguration: [US] }
  ) {
    errors {
      field
      message
    }
    taxConfiguration {
      countries {
        country {
          code
        }
        taxCalculationStrategy
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## Flat rates

Flat rates are the default tax calculation strategy that is enabled for any new sales channel. With this method, you can configure static tax rates and associate them with products, product types, or shipping methods. Tax rates can be defined as default country rates or overridden for specific products with tax classes.

### Enabling flat rates for a channel

To enable flat rates, use the following mutation:

```graphql
mutation {
  taxConfigurationUpdate(
    id: "VGF4Q29uZmlndXJhdGlvbjox"
    input: { taxCalculationStrategy: FLAT_RATES }
  ) {
    errors {
      field
      message
    }
    taxConfiguration {
      taxCalculationStrategy
    }
  }
}
```

`VGF4Q29uZmlndXJhdGlvbjox` is the ID of the tax configuration object related to the channel. See [Fetching tax configurations](developer/taxes.mdx#fetching-tax-configurations) to learn how to get the ID.

### Creating a default country rate

The default country rate is used for products and shipping methods when there is no other tax class assigned to them. To provide a default tax rate for a country, use the following mutation:

```graphql
mutation {
  taxCountryConfigurationUpdate(
    countryCode: PL
    updateTaxClassRates: [{ rate: 23 }]
  ) {
    taxCountryConfiguration {
      country {
        code
      }
      taxClassCountryRates {
        rate
      }
    }
    errors {
      field
      message
    }
  }
}
```

In this example, we’re setting the default tax rate for Poland to 23%.

### Assigning a specific tax rate to a product

To create a tax rate that would be used only for specific products, you must create a tax class and assign it to the product. In the example below, we’re creating a tax class “Healthcare products” with an 8% tax rate for Poland:

```graphql
mutation {
  taxClassCreate(
    input: {
      name: "Healthcare products"
      createCountryRates: [{ countryCode: PL, rate: 8 }]
    }
  ) {
    errors {
      field
      message
    }
    taxClass {
      id
      countries {
        rate
      }
    }
  }
}
```

To assign the tax class to a product, use the following mutation:

```graphql
mutation {
  productUpdate(id: "UHJvZHVjdDox", input: { taxClass: "VGF4Q2xhc3M6Mg==" }) {
    errors {
      field
      message
    }
    product {
      taxClass {
        name
      }
    }
  }
}
```

When the product is added to checkout, Saleor will use the 8% tax rate.

:::tip
You can assign tax classes to products directly, or you can assign them to product types using the `productTypeUpdate` mutation. When a product type has a tax class assigned, all products of this type will use it, as long as they don’t have their own tax rates assigned.
:::

### Shipping tax rate

Saleor supports two different methods for calculating tax rates:
- Static tax rates using tax classes – You can assign a tax class to a shipping method to apply a fixed tax rate.
- Weighted tax rates based on order lines – Starting from Saleor 3.21, it's also possible to calculate the shipping tax as a weighted average of the tax rates from the lines in the checkout/order.


#### Using tax class to get tax rate to a shipping method

To calculate taxes on shipping, you can either configure [the default tax rate for a country](developer/taxes.mdx#creating-a-default-country-rate) or create a custom tax class and assign it to the shipping method. Here is an example:

```graphql
mutation {
  shippingPriceUpdate(
    id: "U2hpcHBpbmdNZXRob2RUeXBlOjE="
    input: { taxClass: "VGF4Q2xhc3M6Mg==" }
  ) {
    errors {
      field
      message
    }
    shippingMethod {
      taxClass {
        name
      }
    }
  }
}
```


#### Using weighted shipping tax rate

In some countries, when shipping products with different tax rates, the tax on shipping must be calculated as a **weighted average** based on the net values and tax rates of the order lines.

Saleor supports this behavior through a configuration option.

:::note
This feature is only available when using the `FLAT_RATES` tax calculation strategy.
If enabled with any other strategy, the mutation will raise an exception.
:::


##### Enabling weighted shipping tax rate

To enable weighted tax calculation for shipping, use the following mutation:

```graphql
mutation {
  taxConfigurationUpdate(
    id: "VGF4Q29uZmlndXJhdGlvbjox"
    input: {
      useWeightedTaxForShipping: true, 
      taxCalculationStrategy: FLAT_RATES
    }
  ) {
    taxConfiguration {
      useWeightedTaxForShipping
    }
    errors {
      field
      message
    }
  }
}
```


##### Enabling for a specific country

You can also configure the weighted shipping tax rate for specific countries:

```graphql
mutation {
  taxConfigurationUpdate(
    id: "VGF4Q29uZmlndXJhdGlvbjox"
    input: {
      updateCountriesConfiguration: [
        {
          countryCode: CA, 
          taxCalculationStrategy: FLAT_RATES, 
          useWeightedTaxForShipping: true, 
          chargeTaxes: true, 
          displayGrossPrices: true
        }
      ]
    }
  ) {
    taxConfiguration {
      useWeightedTaxForShipping
      countries {
        countryCode
        useWeightedTaxForShipping
      }
    }
    errors {
      field
      message
    }
  }
}
```

This mutation enables weighted tax calculation for orders shipped to `Canada`.


##### How weighted tax for shipping is calculated

###### Case 1: all products with the same VAT rate

| Products (net) | VAT rate | Resulting shipping VAT rate |
| -------------- | -------- | --------------------------- |
| 100            | 23%      | 23%                         |
| 100            | 8%       | 8%                          |

When all products share the same tax rate, the shipping inherits that rate.



#### Case 2: products with different VAT rates

In this case, the shipping tax is calculated as a **weighted average**:

```text
Weighted rate = 
(Σ line_net_price × line_tax_rate) / (Σ line_net_price)
```

####### Example 1

| Products (net) | VAT rate |
| -------------- | -------- |
| 100            | 23%      |
| 100            | 8%       |

```text
Weighted shipping VAT = (100×0.23 + 100×0.08) / (100 + 100) = 15.5%
```

**Result:** shipping taxed at **15.5%**

---

####### Example 2

| Products (net) | VAT rate |
| -------------- | -------- |
| 20             | 23%      |
| 80             | 8%       |

```text
Weighted shipping VAT = (20×0.23 + 80×0.08) / (20 + 80) = 11%
```

**Result:** shipping taxed at **11%**


### Querying products with taxed prices for a specific country

When using flat rates, the API can list products with prices that include tax rates for different countries. To do this, pass the country code for which you have flat rate configurations available. If the `country` argument is not specified, the default country for the channel is assumed. (See [Channel.defaultCountry](api-reference/channels/objects/channel.mdx).)

In this example, we are fetching a product list with prices for Poland.

```graphql
{
  products(channel: "default-channel", first: 20) {
    edges {
      node {
        id
        name
        pricing(address: { country: PL }) {
          priceRange {
            start {
              currency
              gross {
                amount
              }
              net {
                amount
              }
            }
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### Rounding

The following rounding rule is applied to the tax calculation:

`If the discarded fraction is >= 0.5, round up; if the discarded fraction is < 0.5, then round down`

Examples:

`$9.945 => $9.95`

`$9.94499 => $9.94`

Precision for most currencies is calculated up to 2 decimal places.

## Dynamic taxes

Dynamic taxes let you delegate the tax calculation to external apps, including 3rd-party tax providers like Avalara, TaxJar, or custom tax apps. This means that your store can use real-time tax rates from external sources instead of setting up static tax rates. This method is useful when your store operates in multiple countries or regions with complex tax rules or when you want to automate the tax calculation process.

To learn more about configuring dynamic taxes, navigate to the [Tax Webhooks](developer/extending/webhooks/synchronous-events/tax.mdx) page.

To enable dynamic taxes in a channel use:

```graphql
mutation {
  taxConfigurationUpdate(
    id: "VGF4Q29uZmlndXJhdGlvbjox"
    input: { taxCalculationStrategy: TAX_APP, taxAppId: "saleor.tax" }
  ) {
    errors {
      field
      message
    }
    taxConfiguration {
      taxCalculationStrategy
    }
  }
}
```

If you decide to set `taxAppId` [checkoutComplete](api-reference/checkout/mutations/checkout-complete.mdx) and [draftOrderComplete](api-reference/orders/mutations/draft-order-complete.mdx) mutations will fail if your Tax App doesn't respond or provide invalid data.
From Saleor 4.0 forward `taxAppId` will become mandatory when `TAX_APP` is set as `taxCalculationStrategy`.

If you use the `TAX_APP` calculation strategy and decide not to set `taxAppId` then Saleor will try to iterate through all installed Apps and return the first result.
In case when any app doesn't respond, [checkoutComplete](api-reference/checkout/mutations/checkout-complete.mdx) and [draftOrderComplete](api-reference/orders/mutations/draft-order-complete.mdx) mutations will proceed without errors.

## Tax exemption

The [Tax Exemption API](api-reference/taxes/mutations/tax-exemption-manage.mdx) allows you to exempt checkouts or orders from taxes, regardless of any channel or country-specific configuration. Note that this API is restricted to users with the `MANAGE_TAXES` permission.

To exempt a checkout from taxes, use the following mutation:

```graphql
mutation {
  taxExemptionManage(
    id: "Q2hlY2tvdXQ6ZTZiMzAzYmMtMzc2Zi00YThkLTkxYzAtNmU3MjYyNDU1OWU3"
    taxExemption: true
  ) {
    errors {
      field
      message
    }
    taxableObject {
      ... on Checkout {
        taxExemption
      }
    }
  }
}
```

For orders, pass the order ID as an argument and adjust the query to fetch the order data in the `taxableObject` field. To re-enable tax charging, pass `taxExemption: false`.

## Address for tax calculation

The process of determining the country code follows this sequence:

1. Shipping address
2. Billing address
3. The channel's default country

:::note
The table provides examples to help understand how tax calculation is determined based on the address.
:::

|             | Store Address | Shipping Address | Billing Address | Warehouse Address |
| ----------- | ------------- | ---------------- | --------------- | ----------------- |
| Country     | US            | US               | US              | US                |
| CountryArea | LA            | VA               | TX              | VT                |

### Example for shipable products

- Create a checkout with channel and lines. Since the shipping and billing addresses are empty, taxes are calculated based on the store address (Country US, state LA)
- Update the billing address. The shipping address is still empty, but since the billing address is now available, taxes are calculated based on it (Country US, state TX)
- Update the shipping address. Taxes are now calculated based on the shipping address (Country US, state VA).

### Example for digital products

- Create a checkout with channel and non-shippable lines. Since the shipping and billing addresses are empty, taxes are calculated based on the store address (Country US, state LA)
- Update the billing address. Taxes are calculated based on it (Country US, state TX)

:::warning
It's possible to set shipping address in the checkoutCreate mutation. In this case, the shipping address will be used for tax calculation since we always prioritize shipping address over billing address.
:::

### Example for click and collect shipping

- Create a checkout with channel and lines. Since the shipping address is empty, taxes are calculated based on the store address (Country US, state LA)
- Update the billing address. Taxes are calculated based on the billing address (Country US, state TX)
- Update the shipping address. Taxes are calculated based on the shipping address (Country US, state VA).
- Update the delivery method with the ID of availableCollectionPoint. The shipping address has been changed to the warehouse address. Taxes are now calculated based on the warehouse address. (Country US, state VT)
