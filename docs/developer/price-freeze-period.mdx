This feature was introduced in **Saleor 3.21**. In previous versions, the base prices were refreshed with every single recalculation.
:::

## Introduction
The base price of a product is determined at the moment it is added to an order. 
However, product prices may change throughout the order lifecycle. 
To maintain price consistency over time, regardless of updates to the product catalog, Saleor provides a price freeze period.


### Draft Orders
For draft orders, Saleor retains the initial base price of an order line for 24 hours by default.
After this period, the base price is considered outdated and will be refreshed based on the current product catalog.

The default freeze period is controlled by the [`channel`](developer/channels/configuration.mdx) setting `draftOrderLinePriceFreezePeriod`. 
To disable automatic price refreshing, set this value to `null` or `0`.


### Unconfirmed Orders
Unconfirmed orders — those originating from checkout — do not refresh their base prices at any point.


### Non-Editable Orders
Orders with statuses other than `DRAFT` and `UNCONFIRMED` are not editable so can't be recalculated. 


### How It Works
When a product is added to an order, Saleor sets an expiration time for the order line. 
Once this period has passed, the line's base price will be updated based on the current product price.
This update also reflects any changes in applied discounts. 
For example, if a voucher reduced the line price and the voucher value has changed since the initial calculation, 
the line price will be adjusted based on the new voucher value.


### Exceptions
- The price will not expire if the line price was [overridden](api-reference/orders/inputs/order-line-create-input.mdx#orderlinecreateinputpricepositivedecimal--).
