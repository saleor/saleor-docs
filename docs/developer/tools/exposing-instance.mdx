There are situations when you would like to expose your local environment to external clients, for example:

- show your project to the manager.
- integrate with the new payment gateway, which requires a return URL.
- testing app deployed in the cloud.

To achieve that, you are going to need service for redirecting the traffic. Such service delivers [ngrok](https://ngrok.com) and [localtunnel](https://localtunnel.me). Both are great for our use case, and you can choose any of those.

## Using ngrok

1. Start Saleor on your machine
2. Follow [ngrok installation guide](https://ngrok.com/product)
3. Start a tunnel in your command line `ngrok http 8000`
4. Your server is now exposed under ngrok domain (for example: http://92832de0.ngrok.io). Copy that address.
5. Enter ngrok URL at [Site Settings](dashboard/configuration/site.md) configuration.
