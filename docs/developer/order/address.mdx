## Customer Address Saving Strategies

:::info
This feature was introduced in **Saleor 3.21**.
:::

Address updates allow configuring the address-saving strategy for both shipping and billing addresses.
This setting determines whether the shipping or billing address should be saved in the customer's address book.
This setting takes effect only when a draft order is completed for an existing user.
If no user is assigned, the setting is ignored.

By default, both billing and shipping addresses are not saved in the customer's address book.

### Use cases:
- Draft order management: Allows staff user to explicitly decide whether to save newly entered addresses to the customer account.

### Applicable Order Mutations
The default behavior can be adjusted in the following order mutations:
- [draftOrderCreate](/api-reference/orders/mutations/draft-order-create)
```graphql
mutation DraftOrderCreate(
  $input: DraftOrderCreateInput!
) {
  draftOrderCreate(
    input: $input
  ) {
    order {
      id
    }
  }
} 
```
example input data:
```json {5,15}
{
  "input": {
    "user": "VXNlcjoxNDM2",
    "lines": [{ "quantity": 1, "variantId": "UHJvZHVjdFZhcmlhbnQ6Mjk3" }],
    "saveBillingAddress": true,
    "billingAddress": {
      "firstName": "John"
      "lastName": "Doe"
      "streetAddress1": "1470  Pinewood Avenue"
      "city": "Michigan"
      "postalCode": "49855"
      "country": "US"
      "countryArea": "MI"
    },
    "saveShippingAddress": false,
    "shippingAddress": {
      "firstName": "John"
      "lastName": "Doe"
      "streetAddress1": "1470  Pinewood Avenue"
      "city": "Michigan"
      "postalCode": "49855"
      "country": "US"
      "countryArea": "MI"
    },
    "channelId": "Q2hhbm5lbDoyMjQ0",
  }
}
```
- [draftOrderUpdate](/api-reference/orders/mutations/draft-order-update.mdx)
```graphql
mutation DraftOrderUpdate(
  $id: ID!,
  $input: DraftOrderInput!,
) {
  draftOrderUpdate(
    id: $id,
    input: $input
  ) {
    order {
        userEmail
        externalReference
    }
  }
}
```
example input data:
```json {7}
{
  "id": "T3JkZXI6ZGJlZjkxZmQtMjMxZS00ZGNmLTk5ZGMtNGQxOTBhNDFjYTQ1",
  "input": {
    "shippingAddress": {
        "postalCode": "22-356"
    },
    "saveShippingAddress": false
  }
}
```

### Important Notes

The setting is treated as part of the address and cannot be provided independently in the mutation input.
Attempting to set `saveShippingAddress` or `saveBillingAddress` without including the corresponding
`shippingAddress` or `billingAddress` will result in an error.

For example, providing `saveShippingAddress` in the `draftOrderUpdate` mutation without including `shippingAddress` will raise an error:
```graphql
mutation DraftOrderUpdate(
  $id: ID!,
  $input: DraftOrderInput!,
) {
  draftOrderUpdate(
    id: $id,
    input: $input
  ) {
    order {
      userEmail
      externalReference
    }
  }
}
```

invalid input data:
```json {5}
{
  "id": "T3JkZXI6ZGJlZjkxZmQtMjMxZS00ZGNmLTk5ZGMtNGQxOTBhNDFjYTQ1",
  "input": {
    "externalReference": "ref-XYZ",
    "saveShippingAddress": false
  }
}
```

:::warning
Any update to the address, even a partial change, resets the `saveAddress` flag to its default behavior.
To ensure the correct setting is applied, explicitly provide the `saveAddress` value with each update.
