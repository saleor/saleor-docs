title: Order Update
---

In Saleor, order data can be modified even after it has been created. The type of changes you can make depends on the status of the order:

- **Unconfirmed Orders** can be freely modified using various mutations to change lines, discounts, addresses, and more.
- **Confirmed Orders** can be updated using the [`orderUpdate`](/api-reference/orders/mutations/order-update) mutation to make limited changes such as modifying addresses, metadata, and customer details.

:::note
All mutations related to updating orders require the `MANAGE_ORDERS` permission. Make sure your staff user or app has this permission assigned to perform any order modifications.
:::

This flexibility supports post-checkout changes initiated by either the customer or internal operations, such as customer service corrections, business system integrations, or fulfillment adjustments.

## Updating Confirmed Orders

Once an order is confirmed, you can still make the following updates using the [`orderUpdate`](/api-reference/orders/mutations/order-update) mutation:

### Available Fields

- `billingAddress` – Update the customer's billing address
- `shippingAddress` – Update the customer's shipping address
- `userEmail` – Correct or change the customer's contact email
- `externalReference` – Add or update an external system ID for integrations
- `metadata` / `privateMetadata` – Store public or internal custom metadata for business logic or integrations
- `languageCode` – Set or change the language code for localized communications

### Example Use Cases

- Correcting address typos reported by the customer
- Updating customer email for notification delivery
- Tagging the order with an ERP reference ID
- Storing custom status or fraud-check flags in private metadata
- Changing the language of invoice or email templates

## Updating Unconfirmed Orders

For `UNCONFIRMED` orders, more substantial edits are allowed. These include modifying discounts, lines, and other aspects of the order.

### Managing Order Lines

- [`orderLinesCreate`](/api-reference/orders/mutations/order-lines-create) – Add new product lines to the order
- [`orderLineUpdate`](/api-reference/orders/mutations/order-line-update) – Change the quantity or variant of an existing order line
- [`orderLineDelete`](/api-reference/orders/mutations/order-line-delete) – Remove a product line from the order

### Managing Shipping Method

- [`orderUpdateShipping`](/api-reference/orders/mutations/order-update-shipping) – Change the shipping method for an unconfirmed order

### Managing Discounts 

For more information about adding manual discounts, see the [Manual Discounts](/developer/discounts/manual-discounts) documentation.

#### Order Level Discounts

- [`orderDiscountAdd`](/api-reference/orders/mutations/order-discount-add) – Add a discount to the entire order
- [`orderDiscountUpdate`](/api-reference/orders/mutations/order-discount-update) – Update an existing order-level discount
- [`orderDiscountDelete`](/api-reference/orders/mutations/order-discount-delete) – Remove a discount from the order

#### Order Line Level Discounts

- [`orderLineDiscountUpdate`](/api-reference/orders/mutations/order-line-discount-update) – Apply or modify a discount on a specific order line
- [`orderLineDiscountRemove`](/api-reference/orders/mutations/order-line-discount-remove) – Remove a line-level discount

### Other Changes

The [`orderUpdate`](/api-reference/orders/mutations/order-update) mutation can still be used for unconfirmed orders to change:
- Customer email
- Billing and shipping addresses
- Order metadata

## Order Updates Summary

| Order State | What Can Be Modified |
|--------------|----------------------|
| Orders in `UNCONFIRMED` status | Lines, line discounts, order-level discounts, shipping method, addresses, email, metadata | 
| Confirmed orders in `UNFULFILLED`, `FULFILLED`, or `RETURNED` status | Addresses, email, external references, language, metadata |

This structured approach ensures safe and controlled edits at each stage of the order lifecycle, balancing flexibility and data integrity.

## Managing Order Notes

You can add or update notes on orders using the following mutations:

- [`orderNoteAdd`](/api-reference/orders/mutations/order-note-add) – Add a new note to the order
- [`orderNoteUpdate`](/api-reference/orders/mutations/order-note-update) – Update an existing order note

Order notes are stored in the order's events and will be displayed in the Saleor Dashboard's Order History section. 
These notes are accessible to staff users and apps with the MANAGE_ORDERS permission.

This feature is useful for:

- Recording customer service interactions
- Documenting special handling instructions
- Tracking order-related issues and resolutions
- Adding internal comments about the order
