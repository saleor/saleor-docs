title: Gift cards
---

## Introduction

Gift cards can be created by staff users or bought by customers as a standard product.
They can have an expiry date set or can never expired.
Gift cards are not assigned to any channel, they can be used in any channel
whose currency is the same as the currency of the gift card.
During the first gift card usage, the customer user is assigned to the gift card and
then the card can be used only by this user.

## Creating gift cards by staff

The staff user with `MANAGE_GIFT_CARD` permission can create a single gift card
or a bunch of gift cards at once.

The following example shows how the single gift card can be created.
If `userEmail` is provided and the email plugin is configured for provided channel, 
the gift card is sent to the customer and the `SENT_TO_CUSTOMER` event is created.
In this example expiry date will be set, as `expiryDate` value is provided,
If you want to create never expired card, do not provide `expiryDate` value.

```graphql {2-12}
mutation {
  giftCardCreate(
    input: {
      balance: {
        amount: 100,
        currency: "USD",
      },
      userEmail: "test@example.com",
      channel: "channel-USD",
      expiryDate: "2050-10-10",
      isActive: true,
    }
  ) {
    giftCard {
      id
      displayCode
      isActive
      expiryDate
      initialBalance {
        currency
        amount
      }
      currentBalance {
        currency
        amount
      }
      createdBy {
        email
      }
      usedBy {
        email
      }
      createdByEmail
      usedByEmail
      events {
        type
        user {
          email
        }
        app {
          name
        }
        expiryDate
        balance {
          initialBalance {
            amount
            currency
          }
          oldInitialBalance {
            amount
            currency
          }
          currentBalance {
            amount
            currency
          }
          oldCurrentBalance {
            amount
            currency
          }
        }
      }
    }
    errors {
      field
      message
      code
    }
  }
}
```

As a response, we get a newly created active gift card with initial and current balance,
generated code, and two events:
- `ISSUED` which informs that gift card has been created by staff,
- `SENT_TO_CUSTOMER` as the `userEmail` has been providedÂ and gift card has been sent.
Also the staff user that run mutation has been assigned as `createdBy` user.
As the card hasn't been used yet, the field `usedByUser` is empty.

```graphql
{
  "data": {
    "giftCardCreate": {
      "giftCard": {
        "id": "R2lmdENhcmQ6MTE=",
        "code": "ABCD-EFGH-IJKL",
        "displayCode": "****IJKL",
        "isActive": true,
        "expiryDate": null,
        "initialBalance": {
          "currency": "USD",
          "amount": 100.0
        },
        "currentBalance": {
          "currency": "USD",
          "amount": 100.0
        },
        "createdBy": {
          "email": "admin@example.com"
        },
        "usedBy": null,
        "createdByEmail": "admin@example.com",
        "usedByEmail": null,
        "events": [
          {
            "type": "ISSUED",
            "user": {
              "email": "admin@example.com"
            },
            "app": null,
            "expiryDate": "2050-10-10",
            "balance": {
              "initialBalance": {
                "amount": 100.0,
                "currency": "USD"
              },
              "oldInitialBalance": null,
              "currentBalance": {
                "amount": 100.0,
                "currency": "USD"
              },
              "oldCurrentBalance": null
            }
          }
          {
            "type": "SENT_TO_CUSTOMER",
            "user": {
              "email": "admin@example.com"
            },
            "app": null,
            "balance": null
          }
        ]
      },
      "errors": []
    }
  }
}
```

Creating gift cards in bulk is similar, but you need to specify the number of gift cards
to create and the tag value, that will be assigned to all created gift cards.

```graphql {2-10}
mutation {
  giftCardBulkCreate(
    input: {
      count: 5,
      tag: "example-tag",
      isActive: true,
      balance: {
        amount: 200.0,
        currency: "USD",
      }
    }
  ) {
    count
    giftCards {
      id
      displayCode
      isActive
      tag
    }
    errors {
      code
      field
      message
    }
  }
}
```

We get five new gift cards:
```graphql

  "data": {
    "giftCardBulkCreate": {
      "count": 5,
      "giftCards": [
        {
          "id": "R2lmdENhcmQ6MjU=",
          "displayCode": "****A18F",
          "isActive": true,
          "tag": "example-tag"
        },
        {
          "id": "R2lmdENhcmQ6MjY=",
          "displayCode": "****1A5E",
          "isActive": true,
          "tag": "example-tag"
        },
        {
          "id": "R2lmdENhcmQ6Mjc=",
          "displayCode": "****943C",
          "isActive": true,
          "tag": "example-tag"
        },
        {
          "id": "R2lmdENhcmQ6Mjg=",
          "displayCode": "****F21A",
          "isActive": true,
          "tag": "example-tag"
        },
        {
          "id": "R2lmdENhcmQ6Mjk=",
          "displayCode": "****7F5A",
          "isActive": true,
          "tag": "example-tag"
        }
      ],
      "errors": []
    }
  }
}
```

After creation, you can export gift card codes to CSV,
you can find more information about that here.

## Gift card resending
At any time after creation, you can resend the gift card to the customer.
If the `userEmail` is not provided, the card is sent to the customer who already used the card,
or if the card hasn't been used yet, to the customer that created the card.
Channel is required to choose the correct email plugin to send the gift card.

```graphql {2-7}
mutation {
  giftCardResend(
    input: {
      id: "R2lmdENhcmQ6MjU=",
      channel: "default-channel",
      email: "saleor@example.com"
    }
  ) {
      giftCard {
        id
        code
        events {
          type
          user {
            email
          }
          app {
            name
          }
        }
      }
      errors {
        field
        message
        code
      }
  }
}
```

## Updating gift card
After creation, the tag, expiry date, and balance amount can be updated.

:::note
Remember, only the balance amount can be updated, currency cannot be changed,
and updating is equal to reset the current balance value.
Both initial and current balance is set to the provided value, no matter
if the card was already used or not.
:::

The following example shows updating the expiry date, tag, and balance amount reset.
```graphql {2-7}
mutation {
  giftCardUpdate(
    id: "R2lmdENhcmQ6MjU=",
    input: {
      balanceAmount:  70,
      expiryDate: "2040-10-10",
      tag: "new-tag",
    }
  ) {
  giftCard {
    id
    displayCode
    isActive
    expiryDate
    initialBalance {
      currency
      amount
    }
    currentBalance {
      currency
      amount
    }
    events {
      type
      user {
        email
      }
      app {
        name
      }
      expiryDate
      oldExpiryDate
      oldTag
      tag
      balance {
        initialBalance {
            amount
            currency
        }
        oldInitialBalance {
            amount
            currency
        }
        currentBalance {
            amount
            currency
        }
        oldCurrentBalance {
            amount
            currency
        }
      }
    }
    errors {
      field
      message
      code
    }
  }
}
```

As a result we get the updated gift card with new events
`BALANCE_RESET`, `EXPIRY_DATE_UPDATED` and `TAG_UPDATED`
as balance, expiry date and tag has been changed.
```graphql
{
  "data": {
    "giftCardUpdate": {
      "giftCard": {
        "id": "R2lmdENhcmQ6MjU=",
        "displayCode": "****A18F",
        "isActive": true,
        "expiryDate": "2040-10-10",
        "initialBalance": {
          "currency": "USD",
          "amount": 70.0
        },
        "currentBalance": {
          "currency": "USD",
          "amount": 70.0
        },
        "events": [
          {
            "type": "ISSUED",
            "user": {
              "email": "admin@example.com"
            },
            "app": null,
            "expiryDate": null,
            "oldExpiryDate": null,
            "oldTag": null,
            "tag": null,
            "balance": {
              "initialBalance": {
                "amount": 200.0,
                "currency": "USD"
              },
              "oldInitialBalance": null,
              "currentBalance": {
                "amount": 200.0,
                "currency": "USD"
              },
              "oldCurrentBalance": null
            }
          },
          {
            "type": "BALANCE_RESET",
            "user": {
              "email": "admin@example.com"
            },
            "app": null,
            "expiryDate": null,
            "oldExpiryDate": null,
            "oldTag": null,
            "tag": null,
            "balance": {
              "initialBalance": {
                "amount": 70.0,
                "currency": "USD"
              },
              "oldInitialBalance": {
                "amount": 200.0,
                "currency": "USD"
              },
              "currentBalance": {
                "amount": 70.0,
                "currency": "USD"
              },
              "oldCurrentBalance": {
                "amount": 200.0,
                "currency": "USD"
              }
            }
          },
          {
            "type": "EXPIRY_DATE_UPDATED",
            "user": {
              "email": "admin@example.com"
            },
            "app": null,
            "expiryDate": "2040-10-10",
            "oldExpiryDate": null,
            "oldTag": null,
            "tag": null,
            "balance": null
          }
          {
            "type": "TAG_UPDATED",
            "user": {
              "email": "admin@example.com"
            },
            "app": null,
            "expiryDate": null,
            "oldExpiryDate": null,
            "oldTag": "example-tag",
            "tag": "new-tag",
            "balance": null
          }
        ]
      },
      "errors": []
    }
  }
}
```

## Activation and deactivation
Cards could be activated and deactivated at any time.
You can activate and deactivate a single card or a bunch of cards.

To deactivate gift card just provide `id` of the card to deactivate.
```graphql {2}
mutation {
  giftCardDeactivate(id: "R2lmdENhcmQ6MjY=") {
    errors {
      field
      message
    }
    giftCard {
      id
      isActive
      events {
        type
        user {
          email
        }
        app {
          name
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

The deactivated gift card has been return with `DEACTIVATED` event.

```graphql
{
  "data": {
    "giftCardDeactivate": {
      "errors": [],
      "giftCard": {
        "id": "R2lmdENhcmQ6MjY=",
        "isActive": false,
        "events": [
          {
            "type": "ISSUED",
            "user": {
              "email": "admin@example.com"
            },
            "app": null
          },
          {
            "type": "DEACTIVATED",
            "user": {
              "email": "admin@example.com"
            },
            "app": null
          }
        ]
      }
    }
  }
}
```

And similar for activation:
```graphql {2}
mutation {
  giftCardActivate(id: "R2lmdENhcmQ6MjY=") {
    errors {
      field
      message
    }
    giftCard {
      id
      isActive
      events {
        type
        user {
            email
        }
        app {
            name
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```
And we get active gift card with new `ACTIVATED` event:
```graphql
{
  "data": {
    "giftCardActivate": {
      "errors": [],
      "giftCard": {
        "id": "R2lmdENhcmQ6MjY=",
        "isActive": true,
        "events": [
          {
            "type": "ISSUED",
            "user": {
              "email": "admin@example.com"
            },
            "app": null
          },
          {
            "type": "DEACTIVATED",
            "user": {
              "email": "admin@example.com"
            },
            "app": null
          },
          {
            "type": "ACTIVATED",
            "user": {
              "email": "admin@example.com"
            },
            "app": null
          }
        ]
      }
    }
  }
}
```

For bulk activation use [giftCardBulkActivate](/developer/api-reference/mutations/gift-card-bulk-activate.mdx)
and for bulk deactivation use [giftCardBulkDeactivate](developer/api-reference/mutations/gift-card-bulk-deactivate.mdx) mutation.

## Creating gift card products
Allowing customers to buy gift cards in your shop is pretty simple,
you just need to create gift card products.
Firstly you have to create a product type with  `GIFT_CARD` kind (use [productTypeCreate](/developer/api-reference/mutations/product-type-create.mdx) for that)
and then create a product (use [productCreate](/developer/api-reference/mutations/product-create.mdx) mutation)
with this product type and that's it.

:::note
If you want to have an unlimited number of gift cards in your shop you should create stock 
n a chosen channel with at least one quantity and unset track inventory flag.
:::

# Buying gift cards
Order setting `automaticallyFulfillNonShippableGiftCard` defines when the bought gift cards
will be created. If this flag is set to `True`, a gift card will be created during checkout completing.
The fulfillment will be created automatically, a gift card will be generated and sent to the customer.
If this option is unset, the gift card will be created during order fulfillment, and after that also sent to the customer.
The value of this option can be changed with use of [orderSettingsUpdate](/developer/api-reference/mutations/order-settings-update.mdx) mutation.

The expiry date of created gift cart is set based on gift card settings.
Gift card settings can be set to never expiry or expiry period, based on which the card expiry date is calculated.

The gift card settings are set as never expiry by default and can be changed with use of [giftCardSettingsUpdate](/developer/api-reference/mutations/gift-card-settings-update.mdx).
In the following example the gif card settings are set to 12 months.

```graphql {2-9}
mutation {
  giftCardSettingsUpdate(
    input: {
      expiryType: EXPIRY_PERIOD,
      expiryPeriod: {
        type: YEAR,
        amount: 12
      }
    }
  ) {
    giftCardSettings {
      expiryType
      expiryPeriod {
        type
        amount
      }
    }
    errors {
      code
      field
    }
  }
}
```

As a result we get updated expiry settings.
```graphql
{
  "data": {
    "giftCardSettingsUpdate": {
      "giftCardSettings": {
        "expiryType": "EXPIRY_PERIOD",
        "expiryPeriod": {
          "type": "YEAR",
          "amount": 12
        }
      },
      "errors": []
    }
  }
}
```


## Using gift card in checkout
To use gift card in checkout just run [checkoutAddPromoCode](/developer/api-reference/mutations/checkout-add-promo-code.mdx)
mutation with gift card code.
When the gift card is used for the first time, the checkout user will be assigned to this gift card. 
If the card was already used, the checkout user will be compared with the gift card user,
when the users differ, a validation error is raised.
Also, remember that the channel currency must be the same as the card currency.
