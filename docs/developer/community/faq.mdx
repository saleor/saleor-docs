## I cannot log in to the dashboard. I receive an error: ‘saleor ran into an unexpected problem’. What actions should I take?

Make sure that you have set the environment variables.

There are two environment variables available for configuration:

- `API_URI` (required): URI of the GraphQL API endpoint of a running instance of Saleor. If you are running Saleor locally with the default settings, set `API_URI` to: `http://localhost:8000/graphql/`.

- `APP_MOUNT_URI`: URI at which the Dashboard app will be mounted. E.g. if you set `APP_MOUNT_URI` to `/dashboard/``, your app will be mounted at `http://localhost:9000/dashboard/`.

- `STATIC_URL`: URL where the static files are located. E.g. if you use S3 bucket, you should set it to the bucket's URL. By default, Saleor assumes you serve static files from the root of your site at `http://localhost:9000/`.

You can find the instructions on how to install and run the dashboard here:

https://github.com/mirumee/saleor-dashboard#getting-started

If you still cannot log in to the dashboard, please contact us on Spectrum.

## How to make Saleor work in production with Ubuntu 19.10/Nginx/Gunicorn server?

You will need to perform the following actions:

- Build the storefront and the dashboard.

- Upload both to separate folders on the server.

- Create separate location entries in your Nginx config for the backend, the dashboard, and the storefront.

    ```
    location /graphql/ {
        proxy_pass http://localhost:8000;
    }

    location / {
        root /path/to/your/storefront;
    }

    location /dashboard/ {
        root /path/to/your/dashboard;
    }
    ```

If you still have any issues, please contact us on Spectrum.

## I receive an error 405. What does it mean?

- Please check if you have set the environment variables API_URI

- Please check if the app is actually connected to the API

- You can investigate the connection in the Network tab in your browser’s dev tools. Please look for GraphQL requests.

If you still have any issues, please [contact us on Spectrum](https://spectrum.chat/saleor) or [Gitter](https://gitter.im/mirumee/saleor).

## How can I run Saleor locally?

We’ve recently introduced a new repository: [saleor-platform](https://github.com/mirumee/saleor-platform). You can run all Saleor components (GraphQL API, Storefront, Dashboard) from one place by using Docker. Please, bear in mind that Saleor-Platform repository has only been designed for local development. If you still have any issues, please contact us on Gitter or Spectrum.

## How can I add a custom payment gateway to Saleor?

See [Extending Saleor](developer/extending/plugins.mdx).

## How to set up the environment variables?

See [Configuration](developer/running-saleor/configuration.mdx#setting-environment-variables).

## Why is Razorpay not available in the storefront?

Razorpay is currently only supported for implementation on the API. You need to separately prepare your storefront for using Razorpay.

## After deploying Saleor on Heroku, the platform is not working. What should I do?

You need to configure all three apps (GraphQL API, Dashboard, Storefront) in Nginx:

- `/` goes to the static site generated from the storefront

- `/dashboard/` goes to the static site of the dashboard

- `/graphql/` goes to the Django instance.

## How can I set taxes for my country?

Currently, Saleor supports the following external tax providers: Avalara (USA) and Vatlayer (European Union). If you would like to use other tax providers, you will need to create a plugin.

You can find more information [here](developer/extending/plugins.mdx).

## How can I create and integrate a custom tool to Saleor?

Firstly, please figure out what Saleor needs to know about the custom tool that you would like to use. There is a possibility of direct communication between the storefront and tool. This is the case with most content management systems.

If you need to communicate Saleor with other tools, consider writing a plugin or creating an extension.

## How to check GraphQL responses and requests from Saleor log?

You can check GraphQL responses in the browser dev console, on the network tab.

Saleor also supports the OpenTracing protocol allowing full in-depth analysis of all GraphQL queries. You can read more about it here: [Monitoring](developer/running-saleor/monitoring.mdx).

## Why have images not been published after deploying Saleor on AWS?

In this case, please check the file permissions. They are set as private by default. It's fully up to the user which files they would like to publish.

You can find more information on the file permissions here: https://django-storages.readthedocs.io/en/latest/backends/amazon-S3.html

## Can I run all Saleor components from one repository?

You can run all Saleor components from one repository only by using [saleor-platform](https://github.com/mirumee/saleor-platform). You will need to use Docker Compose for this. Please bear in mind that saleor-platform has only been designed for local development.

## What is the current structure of Saleor?

There are three separate apps (three repositories): the core - GraphQL API, Dashboard, and Storefront. You can find them in the links below. In order to run all three components, please follow the instructions from the readme section of each repository:

- [Core](https://github.com/mirumee/saleor)

- [Saleor Storefront](https://github.com/mirumee/saleor-storefront)

- [Saleor Dashboard](https://github.com/mirumee/saleor-dashboard)

If you would like to run Saleor locally from one repository, you can use [saleor-platform](https://github.com/mirumee/saleor-platform).

## Does Saleor support mobile payment apps?

Currently, Saleor does not support mobile payment apps such as Google Pay and Apple Pay. That feature is on our roadmap. However, we can’t yet tell when it will be available.

## Where can I find the old version of Saleor with the Django views and templates?

The old version of Saleor is available [here](https://github.com/mirumee/legacy-views).

Please bear in mind that we do not maintain it anymore.

## Will the old version of Saleor (Django views and templates) receive updates?

We do not maintain the old version of Saleor with Django views and templates. It will not receive any new updates. If you still would like to contribute to the project, we will be happy to review your request.
