## Free orders

You might have a use case where you want to allow customers to complete a checkout without needing to pay. This can be useful for scenarios like:

- Free samples
- Free digital downloads

To allow for this, you can create a checkout with a total price of `0`. This can be achieved by adding a free item to the checkout or by applying a discount code that reduces the total price to `0`.

## Example of checkout flows

### Creating order before processing payment

The advantage of this flow that prices, discount and stock are frozen before payment is created.

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    Customer->>+Custom App: Finalize an order
    Custom App ->>+ Saleor: Create order from checkout
    Saleor -->>- Custom App: Unpaid order
    Custom App-->>-Customer: Order
    Customer ->>+ Custom App: Process payment
    Custom App ->>+ Payment provider: Process payment for order
    Payment provider -->>- Custom App: Payment with proper status
    Custom App ->>+ Saleor: Create transaction for order
    Saleor -->>- Custom App: Transaction created and <br>attached to order
    Custom App -->>- Customer: Order paid
```

### Processing payment before creating an order

```mermaid

    Customer ->>+ Custom App: Process payment
    Custom App ->>+ Payment provider: Process payment for checkout
    Payment provider -->>- Custom App: Payment with proper status
    Custom App ->>+ Saleor: Create transaction for checkout
    Saleor -->>- Custom App: Transaction created and <br>attached to checkout
    Custom App -->>- Customer: Payment paid
    Customer->>+Custom App: Conver checkout into an order
    Custom App ->>+ Saleor: Create order from checkout
    Saleor ->> Saleor: Attach checkout's transactions to order
    Saleor -->>- Custom App: Paid order
    Custom App-->>-Customer: Order
```

### Creating order from checkout without Payments

Creating unpaid orders is possible for channels that have [`allowUnpaidOrders`](/api-reference/miscellaneous/objects/order-settings#ordersettingsallowunpaidordersboolean--) setting enabled.
If you wish to bypass this setting, you can use [`orderCreateFromCheckout`](api-reference/orders/mutations/order-create-from-checkout.mdx).

The operation requires the `HANDLE_CHECKOUTS` permission and can be called only by the App. Calling `checkoutPaymentCreate` and `checkoutComplete` is not necessary.

The created order can be marked as paid by staff customer/app with the `MANAGE_ORDERS` permission.

To create an order from checkout we can pass id of the checkout to [`orderCreateFromCheckout`](api-reference/orders/mutations/order-create-from-checkout.mdx).
