### Missing Shipping Methods

1. Shipping methods are contextual to channels and need to be enabled in the channel the checkout is created.
2. Shipping methods can be available only for specific countries. If checkout does not contain shipping country, the default country of the channel will be used.

### Variant/Product is not available

Make sure product is available in the channel the checkout is created. See [Product Troubleshooting](/developer/products/troubleshooting.mdx).
