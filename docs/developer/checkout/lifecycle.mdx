## Checkout Creation

Upon creation, `checkout` is assigned to a channel that influences product stock, availability, and price. The channel can not be changed after the checkout is created. Learn more about [Channels](/developer/channels/overview.mdx).

Checkout can be created from [existing orders](/developer/order/order-to-checkout.mdx), which is helpful for re-order functionality.

## Authentication in Checkout

Saleor allows you to manage both logged-in customers and guest users using the same API mutations. 
You do not need separate logic branches for different user states; instead, Saleor determines the checkout ownership based on the request's authentication context.

- **With Auth Header:** If the checkout creation request includes a valid user token, the new checkout is automatically "Signed" (linked to that specific User ID).

- **Without Auth Header:** The checkout is created as "Anonymous" (guest). It is identified solely by a unique token and is not linked to any user profile.

### Attaching a Guest Checkout to a User

If a guest user logs in midway through their shopping experience, you can convert their anonymous checkout into a signed one using the [`checkoutCustomerAttach`](/api-reference/checkout/mutations/checkout-customer-attach.mdx) mutation. 
This ensures their items are preserved and linked to their account history.

## Updating Checkout

- **Updating lines**. Each line (product variant) should have at least a quantity of 1; if the line reaches a quantity of 0, it will be automatically removed. Optionally [Price overwrites](/developer/checkout/api-guide.mdx#setting-custom-line-prices) and [Line Stacking](/developer/checkout/api-guide.mdx#creating-two-lines-using-a-single-variant) can be controlled via API.

## Completing Checkout

When checkout is finalized/completed, it is converted into an order.

The following are the requirements to finalize the checkout:

1. The required addresses are valid, except when [`skipValidation`](/developer/address.mdx#skipping-the-address-validation) is used.

2. Delivery options and addresses are valid. [Learn more](/developer/checkout/address).

3. All selected products are in stock (while purchasing, another user could already buy the last available item). See [`Allocations`](/developer/stock/stock-allocation.mdx) and [`Reservations`](/developer/stock/stock-reservation.mdx).

4. The [payments](/developer/payments/overview.mdx) are processed unless the `Channel` setting of the checkout has [`allowUnpaidOrders`](/api-reference/miscellaneous/objects/order-settings#ordersettingsallowunpaidordersboolean---) setting enabled or checkout's total is `0`. If you need to bypass this setting, you use [`orderCreateFromCheckout`](api-reference/orders/mutations/order-create-from-checkout.mdx).

:::note

If case an order is overcharged, it will still be created. The overcharge must be handled manually.

## Checkout Expiration and Deletion

To avoid overloading the database, unfinished and unpaid checkouts are automatically deleted after a specified period from their last modification:

- checkouts without lines after 6 hours,
- anonymous checkouts (neither user nor email is set) with lines after 30 days,
- user checkouts (either user or email is set) with lines after 90 days.

## Releasing Funds for Abandoned Checkouts

Payments for items left in the cart by customers who did not complete the purchase will be refunded to the customer's account.

Abandoned checkout is the checkout that hasn't been changed in a specific period. The TTL is controlled by the environment variable: [`CHECKOUT_TTL_BEFORE_RELEASING_FUNDS`](setup/configuration.mdx#checkout_ttl_before_releasing_funds), a default set to 6 hours.

For any [`transactionItem`](api-reference/payments/objects/transaction-item.mdx) with processed funds (`authorizedAmount` or `chargeAmount`) assigned to abandoned checkout, Saleor will trigger the release action.

The release action is:

- webhook with the event:`TRANSACTION_CANCELATION_REQUESTED` triggered when [`transactionItem`](api-reference/payments/objects/transaction-item.mdx) contains authorized funds
- webhook with the event: `TRANSACTION_REFUND_REQUESTED` triggered when [`transactionItem`](api-reference/payments/objects/transaction-item.mdx) contains charged funds.

The release action is triggered only once. If a subscription for a release event is missing or the app fails to process the action, the release action needs to be handled manually.

To fetch paid checkouts, use the below query:

<Tabs>
<TabItem value="Mutation">
```graphql 
query checkouts($first: Int, $filter: CheckoutFilterInput) {
  checkouts(first: $first, filter: $filter) {
    totalCount
    edges {
      node {
        id
        totalBalance {
          amount
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

</TabItem>

<TabItem value={"Variables"}>
```json {4-7}
{
  "first": 2,
  "filter": {
    "authorizeStatus": [
      "PARTIAL",
      "FULL"
    ]
  }
}
```
</TabItem>

<TabItem value={"Result"}>
```json
{
  "data": {
    "checkouts": {
      "totalCount": 8,
      "edges": [
        {

            }
          }
        },
        {
          "node": {
            "id": "Q2hlY2tvdXQ6MjMzNjllMDYtM2ZlYi00MWEzLWFjMTYtMTE2NjE3ZWIzYTQ5",

              "amount": 117.51
            }
          }
        }
      ]
    }
  }
}
```
</TabItem>
</Tabs>
