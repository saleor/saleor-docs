### Why Is There No Cart Model?

Saleor has no distinct object type for shopping carts and checkouts. We wanted the same features – like discounts, vouchers, address-specific taxes, and shipping estimates – to be available in the cart and the checkout, so we've decided to use the same object type for both.
Checkout provides the interface for standard cart operations like adding products or promo codes. It can also be processed in almost any order, for example, by saving a billing address before adding any items.

### Glossary

- **Checkout**: Object that groups all the data needed for the checkout process and creating an order.
- **Checkout Line**: Items added to the checkout with quantity data. Each added variant has a separate line.
- **Checkout Completion**: During this step, payments may be processed and stocks may be reserved. If requirements are met, the order is created.
- **Payment Gateway**: Payment App or legacy plugin. e.g., [Adyen](developer/app-store/apps/adyen/overview.mdx), [Stripe](/developer/app-store/apps/stripe/overview.mdx).
- **Transaction**: Object containing status and additional data about payment.
- **Shipping Methods**: The way orders will be sent. E.g., DHL courier, postal service.
- **Collection Points**: Places where orders can be self-picked.
- **Delivery Methods**: Union of shipping methods and collection points.

## Multiple Channels and Checkout

Depending on the chosen channel, the user will have access to different objects. This impacts available:

- Products and Product Variants
- Payment Gateways
- Shipping Methods
- Collection Points
- Discounts

## Permissions

A checkout is identified by a UUID-based ID.
Anyone who knows this ID can query or modify the checkout.

### Public Access

The following information can be accessed without authentication if you know the checkout id:

- **Cart details**: products in the checkout, quantities, discounts, totals
- **Addresses & contact**: shipping and billing address, customer email, customer note
- **Delivery options**: shipping requirements, selected delivery method
- **Public metadata**

### Restricted Access

Some fields require ownership or staff/app permissions:

- **User**: returned only to the authenticated owner or staff/app with `MANAGE_CHECKOUTS`
- **Transactions**: require `MANAGE_CHECKOUTS` and `HANDLE_PAYMENTS` 
- **Private metadata**: only staff with `MANAGE_CHECKOUTS`
