### Why Is There No Cart Model?

Saleor does not have distinct object types for shopping carts and checkouts. We designed the system this way so that features like discounts, vouchers, address-specific taxes, and shipping estimates are available in both cart and checkout experiences using the same object type.

Checkout provides the interface for standard cart operations like adding products or promo codes. It can be processed in almost any order—for example, by saving a billing address before adding any items.

### Glossary

- **Checkout**: Object that groups all data needed for the checkout process and order creation.
- **Checkout Line**: Items added to checkout with quantity data. Each added variant has a separate line.
- **Checkout Completion**: During this step, payments are processed and stock is reserved. If requirements are met, an order is created.
- **Payment Gateway**: Payment App or legacy plugin, e.g., [Adyen](developer/app-store/apps/adyen/overview.mdx).
- **Transaction**: Object containing status and additional data about payment.
- **Shipping Methods**: How orders will be delivered, e.g., DHL courier, postal service.
- **Collection Points**: Locations where orders can be picked up by customers.
- **Delivery Methods**: Union of shipping methods and collection points.

## Multiple Channels and Checkout

The chosen channel determines which objects users can access. This affects the availability of:

- Products and Product Variants
- Payment Gateways
- Shipping Methods
- Collection Points
- Discounts

## Permissions

Checkout can be queried only by users assigned to it or users with `MANAGE_CHECKOUTS` permission.

Checkout without an assigned user can be queried and modified without additional permissions—it's public for anyone who knows the checkout ID.
