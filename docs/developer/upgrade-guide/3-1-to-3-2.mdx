title: Saleor 3.2
---

## Preparation

Version 3.2 introduces some breaking changes necessary to ensure the highest quality of our API.

## Default JWT token expiration

Since Saleor 3.2, JWT token expiration is enabled by default. The default expiration time is 5 minutes and can be controlled server-side with `JWT_TTL_ACCESS` environment variable. See [Refreshing an access token](developer/users.mdx#refreshing-an-access-token) to learn how to refresh the token in your client app.

### Notification payloads

This change converts ID's from integers to GraphQL format in all notification payloads (email plugins and `NOTIFY` webhook).

Before:
```json
{
  "user": {
    "id": 68,
   ...
}
```

After:
```json
{
  "user": {
    "id": "VXNlcjo2OA==",
   ...
}
```
