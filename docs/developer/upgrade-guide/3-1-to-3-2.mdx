title: Saleor 3.2
---

## Preparation

Version 3.2 introduces some breaking changes necessary to ensure the highest quality of our API. There were no changes in public APIs, so storefronts do not need any changes to be compatible.

### Notification payloads

This change converts ID's from integers to GraphQL format in all notification payloads (email plugins and `NOTIFY` webhook).

Before:
```json
{
  "user": {
    "id": 68,
   ...
}
```

After:
```json
{
  "user": {
    "id": "VXNlcjo2OA==",
   ...
}
```
