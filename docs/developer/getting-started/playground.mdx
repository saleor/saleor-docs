title: GraphQL Playground
---

Saleor exposes an interactive GraphQL editor under `/graphql/`, allowing access to the API from your browser.

GraphQL Playground is an external interactive editor for your GraphQL queries. It is based on GraphQL and accessible through the web browser. 

Using Playground is easy and intuitive with its sidebar navigation containing two tabs (_Docs_ and _Schema_), listing all operations available in the API. The Playground allows you to quickly familiarize yourself with the API, perform example operations, and send your first queries.

## Authentication

To run queries as the authenticated user, you need to add headers to your request. The headers section is located at the bottom left side of the Playground. To read more, how to get auth tokens, read [User documentation](developer/users.mdx#authentication).
