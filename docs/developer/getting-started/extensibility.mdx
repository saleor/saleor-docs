The obvious way to extend Saleor would be to download the source code and modify it directly. After all it's an open-source platform. We advise against this as experience teaches us that once your store diverges from the upstream Saleor, it becomes hard to keep it updated. Because of this we propose two ways to add functionality to Saleor:

- **Plugins** offer a way to run additional code as part of Saleor Core. They have full access to the database.

- **Apps** are external applications that talk to Saleor Core using its GraphQL API and can subscribe to events using webhooks.

To learn more, see [Extending Saleor](developer/extending.mdx).
