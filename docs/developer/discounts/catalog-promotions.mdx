Catalogue promotions automatically reduce product prices based on conditions you define. Customers see discounted prices on product pages before adding items to their cart.

## Business Use Cases

- **Seasonal sales**: Discount entire categories for holiday promotions
- **Collection spotlight**: Reduce prices on featured collections
- **Clearance**: Mark down specific products to clear inventory
- **Category-wide discounts**: Apply percentage off to all items in a category


## How Catalogue Promotions Work

When you create a catalogue promotion, Saleor:

1. Evaluates all products against the promotion rules
2. Calculates discounted prices asynchronously
3. Updates `ProductVariant.pricing` with the new prices

The discount appears in two pricing fields:

- `priceUndiscounted`: Original price before promotion
- `price`: Price after applying the promotion discount

:::warning
Catalogue discounts are recalculated by a background task. The discounted price won't appear immediately after promotion creation.
:::

## Discount Stacking Rules

When multiple catalogue promotions apply to the same product:

- Only the discount providing **maximum savings** is applied
- Discounts from different rules within the same promotion don't stack
- The system automatically selects the best discount for the customer

To Do: 

## Defining Catalogue Predicates

Catalogue predicates define which products receive the discount. You can target:

- **Products** by ID
- **Product variants** by ID
- **Categories** by ID
- **Collections** by ID

Combine conditions using `AND` and `OR` operators for complex rules. See [filtering documentation](/api-usage/filtering.mdx#general-approach) for predicate syntax.

### Examples

**10% discount on a specific collection:**

```json
{
  "cataloguePredicate": {
    "collectionPredicate": {
      "ids": ["Q29sbGVjdGlvbjox"]
    }
  },
  "rewardValueType": "PERCENTAGE",
  "rewardValue": 10
}
```

**10% discount on a specific category:**

```json
{
  "cataloguePredicate": {
    "categoryPredicate": {
      "ids": ["Q2F0ZWdvcnk6MQ=="]
    }
  },
  "rewardValueType": "PERCENTAGE",
  "rewardValue": 10
}
```

**$10 discount on products from multiple sources:**

```json
{
  "cataloguePredicate": {
    "OR": [
      {
        "collectionPredicate": {
          "ids": ["Q29sbGVjdGlvbjox"]
        }
      },
      {
        "categoryPredicate": {
          "ids": ["Q2F0ZWdvcnk6OA=="]
        }
      },
      {
        "productPredicate": {
          "ids": ["UHJvZHVjdDox"]
        }
      }
    ]
  },
  "rewardValueType": "FIXED",
  "rewardValue": 10
}
```

## Pricing After Discount

After a catalogue promotion applies, the variant pricing reflects the discount:

```json
{
  "productVariant": {
    "pricing": {
      "onSale": true,
      "priceUndiscounted": {
        "gross": { "amount": 90.0 }
      },
      "price": {
        "gross": { "amount": 45.0 }
      },
      "discount": {
        "gross": { "amount": 45.0 }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## Catalogue Promotions in Checkout

When a customer adds a discounted product to checkout:

- The line price reflects the discounted price
- The subtotal is calculated from discounted line prices
- The original price remains visible in `undiscountedUnitPrice`

### Completing Checkout

After completing a checkout with catalogue-discounted items:

```json
{
  "order": {
    "total": { "gross": { "amount": 30.0 } },
    "undiscountedTotal": { "gross": { "amount": 40.0 } },
    "discounts": [],
    "lines": [
      {
        "quantity": 2,
        "unitPrice": { "gross": { "amount": 15.0 } },
        "undiscountedUnitPrice": { "gross": { "amount": 20.0 } },
        "unitDiscount": { "amount": 5.0 }
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

Note that `order.discounts` is empty for catalogue promotions. The discount is visible in:

- The difference between `total` and `undiscountedTotal`
- Each line's `unitDiscount` field
- The difference between `unitPrice` and `undiscountedUnitPrice`

:::info
The promotion discount is not visible on `checkout.discount.amount` for catalogue promotions.

## Combining with Vouchers

Catalogue promotions and vouchers can be combined. When both apply:

1. Catalogue promotion discount applies first
2. Voucher discount applies to the already-discounted price

See [Combining Promotions and Vouchers](/developer/discounts/apply-vouchers.mdx#combining-promotions-and-vouchers) for examples.
