Catalogue promotions automatically reduce product prices based on conditions you define. Customers see discounted prices on product pages before adding items to their cart.

## Business Use Cases

- **Seasonal sales**: Discount entire categories for holiday promotions
- **Collection spotlight**: Reduce prices on featured collections
- **Clearance**: Mark down specific products to clear inventory
- **Category-wide discounts**: Apply percentage off to all items in a category


## How Catalogue Promotions Work

When you create a catalogue promotion, Saleor:

1. Evaluates all products against the promotion rules
2. Calculates discounted prices asynchronously
3. Updates `ProductVariant.pricing` with the new prices

The discount appears in two pricing fields:

- `priceUndiscounted`: Original price before promotion
- `price`: Price after applying the promotion discount

:::warning
Catalogue discounts are recalculated by a background task. The discounted price won't appear immediately after promotion creation.

## Discount Stacking Rules

When multiple catalogue promotions apply to the same product:

- Only one discount providing **maximum savings** is applied
- Discounts from different rules within the same promotion don't stack
- The system automatically selects the best discount for the customer


## Creating Catalogue Promotion

Follow these steps to set up a product-level discount in the Saleor Dashboard.

**1. Start a New Promotion**

    - In the left sidebar, go to **Discounts > Promotions**
    - Click **Create Discount** in the top right corner

**2. General Information**

    - **Name**: Enter a descriptive name (e.g., "Summer Sale")
    - **Type**: Select **Catalogue** to apply the discount to product prices
    - **Description** (Optional): Add details about the promotion for your team
    - **Dates**: Set a **Start Date** and optional **End Date**

**3. Define Promotion Rules**

    Rules determine which products get discounted and by how much.
    - **Rule Name**: Give this specific rule a name (e.g., "20% off summer collection")
    - **Channels**: Select which sales channels this rule applies to (e.g., "Main Store", "Mobile App")
    - **Predicate**: Set which products are included in the promotion:
      - Select **Products**, **Variants**, **Categories**, or **Collections**
      - Choose specific items or groups to discount
      - Use **OR** to include multiple groups (e.g., "Collection X OR Category Y")
    - **Reward**: Choose the discount type:
      - **Percentage**: Enter a percentage (e.g., 10% off)
      - **Fixed Amount**: Enter a fixed discount amount (e.g., $5 off)

**4. Save rule and promotion**

The promotion will automatically apply to matching products. Discounted prices are calculated by a background task and may take a few moments to appear.



## Pricing After Discount

After a catalogue promotion applies, the variant pricing reflects the discount:

```json
{
  "productVariant": {
    "pricing": {
      "onSale": true,
      "priceUndiscounted": {
        "gross": { "amount": 90.0 }
      },
      "price": {
        "gross": { "amount": 45.0 }
      },
      "discount": {
        "gross": { "amount": 45.0 }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## Catalogue Promotions in Checkout

When a customer adds a discounted product to checkout:

- The line price reflects the discounted price
- The subtotal is calculated from discounted line prices
- The original price remains visible in `undiscountedUnitPrice`

### Completing Checkout

After completing a checkout with catalogue-discounted items:

```json
{
  "order": {
    "total": { "gross": { "amount": 30.0 } },
    "undiscountedTotal": { "gross": { "amount": 40.0 } },
    "discounts": [],
    "lines": [
      {
        "quantity": 2,
        "unitPrice": { "gross": { "amount": 15.0 } },
        "undiscountedUnitPrice": { "gross": { "amount": 20.0 } },
        "unitDiscount": { "amount": 5.0 }
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

Note that `order.discounts` is empty for catalogue promotions. The discount is visible in:

- The difference between `total` and `undiscountedTotal`
- Each line's `unitDiscount` field
- The difference between `unitPrice` and `undiscountedUnitPrice`

:::info
The promotion discount is not visible on `checkout.discount.amount` for catalogue promotions.

## Combining with Vouchers

Catalogue promotions and vouchers can be combined. When both apply:

1. Catalogue promotion discount applies first
2. Voucher discount applies to the already-discounted price

See [Combining Promotions and Vouchers](/developer/discounts/apply-vouchers.mdx#combining-promotions-and-vouchers) for examples.
