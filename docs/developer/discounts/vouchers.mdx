Vouchers are a way to apply discounts to orders or they can be used to reduce the cost of a checkout. Vouchers can be applied to the entire order
or to specific products. They can also be limited to a minimum quantity of products in the checkout. Vouchers and [catalog promotions](developer/discounts/promotions-overview.mdx) can be used together.

To learn how to redeem voucher codes during checkout or in draft orders, see [Applying Vouchers](/developer/discounts/apply-vouchers.mdx).

:::info
The vouchers on draft orders are applicable since v3.19.
:::

## Types

Vouchers come in three types:

- `ENTIRE_ORDER`: Applies discount to the checkout subtotal
- `SPECIFIC_PRODUCT`: Applies discount to eligible product unit prices. You define eligibility by linking products, variants, categories, or collections.
- `SHIPPING`: Applies discount to shipping costs. To apply a shipping voucher, the checkout must include shippable products, shipping address, and a shipping method assigned.

Vouchers also have two value types:

- `FIXED`: Reduces price by a specific amount
- `PERCENTAGE`: Reduces price by a specific percentage

:::note
**Vouchers vs Gift Cards**

Vouchers discount the subtotal, unit price, or shipping based on their type and are scoped to channels. 
Gift cards reduce the total price and are currency-based, usable across channels with the same currency.
:::

## Voucher Settings
### Apply Once Per Order
When the `Voucher.applyOncePerOrder` setting is enabled, the discount is applied only once per order, targeting the cheapest item.
The discount affects a single unit, not the entire order line.

- For **product-specific vouchers**: applies to the cheapest item included in the discount.
- For **entire order vouchers**: applies to the cheapest item overall.

### Minimal Order Value
Specifies the minimum checkout subtotal required for the voucher to be applicable.
The value is defined per sales channel via `VoucherChannelListing.minSpent`.

If the subtotal does not meet this threshold, the voucher will not be applied.

**Example:** If `minSpent` is set to 100.00, and the subtotal is 95.96 with 10.00 shipping (total 105.96), the voucher will not be applied.

### Minimal Items Quantity
`Voucher.minCheckoutItemsQuantity` specifies the minimum number of products in the cart required to redeem the voucher. 
This is based on the total quantity of items, not unique products.

### Limit Shipping Vouchers to Specific Countries

`Voucher.countries` defines a list of countries where the shipping voucher can be applied.
- If set, the voucher will only be valid for orders shipping to the specified countries.
- If left empty, the voucher will be valid for all countries.

**Example:**
```json
{
  "countries": ["US", "CA", "GB"]
}
```
In this example, the voucher is only valid for shipments to the United States, Canada, and the United Kingdom.


## Usage Limits
This section explains how to control how many times and by whom a voucher can be redeemed. 
By default, vouchers have no usage limits and can be applied indefinitely. 

### When Usage Is Counted

Voucher usage is **deducted at the order level**, not when a code is applied in checkout.  

- Customers can apply vouchers to multiple checkouts or draft orders.  
- The usage count is only increased once an order is successfully completed.  
- For draft orders, you can decide whether they should be included in voucher usage tracking. See [Draft Order Usage](#draft-order-usage) for details.  
- If a voucher has reached its usage limit:
  - Checkouts or draft orders that already have the voucher applied will fail at **order completion**.  
  - Attempts to apply the voucher to a new checkout or draft order will be rejected immediately.  

This ensures that incomplete or abandoned checkouts do not block other customers from redeeming the voucher, while preventing over-usage once the limit is reached.

### Total Usage Limit

Set **limit number of times this discount can be used in total** (`usageLimit`) to restrict how many times the voucher can be used across all customers.

- Once this number is reached, the voucher can no longer be applied.
- If the voucher includes multiple codes, the limit applies to the total combined usage of all codes.
- The number of times the voucher has been used is shown in the `Voucher.used` field.
- `Voucher.used` only counts usage if a limit was set. 

### Limit to Use Once

**Limit to voucher code use once** (`singleUse`) makes each individual code within a voucher usable only once. After a code is used, it is automatically marked as inactive and cannot be reused.

This setting can only be updated on existing vouchers when no code has been used yet.

:::warning
Voucher `usageLimit` and `singleUse` must be set before the voucher is used. Once the voucher has been applied in any checkout or order, these settings cannot be changed.
:::

### Limit Per Customer
Enable **limit to one use per customer** (`applyOncePerCustomer`) to allow each customer to use the voucher only once, even if the total usage limit hasn’t been reached.

If the same customer tries to use the voucher again, it will be rejected — either when applying the code to a new checkout or at order completion.

### Staff-Only Voucher

Enable **limit to staff only** (`onlyForStaff`) to restrict voucher usage to internal users, such as store staff or admins.

These vouchers will be rejected if applied by non-staff customers, even if all other conditions are met.

:::warning
You can enable or disable `applyOncePerCustomer` or `onlyForStaff` at any time. 
However, these settings do not apply retroactively - for example, if a customer used the voucher before `applyOncePerCustomer` was enabled, they may still be able to use it again.
:::

### Combining Limitations

You can combine different usage limits to control exactly how, how often, and by whom a voucher can be used. Below are common combinations and how they behave in practice:

#### Total Usage Limit + Limit Per Customer

**Setup:**
- One voucher code
- Total usage limit: 50
- Limit to one use per customer: Enabled

**Result:**

The voucher can be used by up to 50 different customers, with each customer allowed only one use. A single customer cannot use the voucher multiple times, and the codes cannot be applied after 50 unique redemptions.

#### Total Usage Limit + Single-Use Codes

**Setup:**
- Generated 10 unique codes
- Total usage limit: 10
- Enable single use setting

**Result:**

The voucher campaign supports 10 redemptions total, each tied to a unique code. Once a code is used, it's deactivated.

#### Single-Use Codes + Staff-Only Voucher

**Setup:**
- Generate 20 unique codes
- Enable single use setting
- Enable Only for staff setting

**Result:**

Each code can be used once, and only by staff users. If a non-staff customer attempts to apply a code, it will be rejected.

### Draft Order Usage

By default, vouchers applied to draft orders do not count toward voucher usage limits. 

If you want draft orders to be included in voucher usage tracking, you can enable this behavior in the channel settings by setting the `includeDraftOrderInVoucherUsage` flag to `true` using the [`channelUpdate`](api-reference/channels/mutations/channel-update.mdx) mutation.

#### Changing the Flag
When you toggle the `includeDraftOrderInVoucherUsage` setting, Saleor adjusts how vouchers are counted and linked to draft orders.

**False → True**

All vouchers are disconnected from existing draft orders. This ensures a clean reset before draft usage starts being counted.

**True → False**

- Multi-use voucher codes: The used count (`VoucherCode.used`) is reduced by the number of draft orders using the code.
- Single-use voucher codes: Become active again (`VoucherCode.isActive = true`).
- Per-customer limits (`applyOncePerCustomer`): The usage will be dissociated from users.


:::note 
When importing draft orders with [`bulkOrderCreate`](developer/bulks/bulk-orders.mdx), vouchers aren't validated and usage isn't counted.
:::

### Releasing Voucher Usage

- Canceling an order: Does not release voucher code usage.
- Order expiration: Releases voucher code usage.
- Deleting a draft order: Releases voucher code usage when draft orders are included in usage tracking.


## Permissions

You need the `MANAGE_DISCOUNTS` permission to manage vouchers.

## Create and Update Vouchers

### Creating a Voucher

To create a voucher use [`voucherCreate`](api-reference/discounts/mutations/voucher-create.mdx) mutation.

API allows to create voucher with multiple codes. To do that use the `addCodes` field to send a list of codes.

:::info
When a voucher contains multiple codes, `voucher.code` returns the first code.

### Updating a Voucher

To update a voucher use [`voucherUpdate`](api-reference/discounts/mutations/voucher-update.mdx) mutation.

Using this mutation voucher codes can be only added. To remove codes use [`voucherDelete`](api-reference/discounts/mutations/voucher-code-bulk-delete.mdx) mutation.

### Selecting Products for Voucher

To make a voucher applicable to specific products, you need to define which items should be eligible for the discount. This can be done by adding or removing products, categories, collections, or variants from the voucher's catalog. The catalog defines the scope of items that the voucher can be applied to.

The `CatalogueInput` type is used to specify which items should be added to or removed from the voucher's catalog. It accepts the following fields:
- `products`: List of product IDs to add/remove
- `categories`: List of category IDs to add/remove
- `collections`: List of collection IDs to add/remove
- `variants`: List of product variant IDs to add/remove

You can provide any combination of these fields in the input. When adding items, the voucher will apply to all specified items. When removing items, the voucher will no longer apply to the specified items.

#### Add Products
To add products, categories, collections, or variants to a voucher, use the [`voucherCataloguesAdd`](api-reference/discounts/mutations/voucher-catalogues-add.mdx) mutation. 
This mutation allows you to specify which items the voucher should apply to.

Here's an example of how to use the mutation:

<Tabs>
<TabItem value="Mutation">
```graphql
mutation VoucherCataloguesAdd($id: ID!, $input: CatalogueInput!) {
  voucherCataloguesAdd(id: $id, input: $input) {
    errors {
      field
      message
      code
    }
    voucher {
      id
      name
      products(first: 10) {
        edges {
          node {
            id
            name
          }
        }
      }
      categories(first: 10) {
        edges {
          node {
            id
            name
          }
        }
      }
      collections(first: 10) {
        edges {
          node {
            id
            name
          }
        }
      }
      variants(first: 10) {
        edges {
          node {
            id
            name
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```
</TabItem>

<TabItem value={"Variables"}>
```json
{
  "id": "Vm91Y2hlcjo0OA==",
  "input": {
    "products": ["UHJvZHVjdDoxNTM=", "UHJvZHVjdDoxNjc="],
    "categories": ["Q2F0ZWdvcnk6MjU="],
    "collections": ["Q29sbGVjdGlvbjo5"],
    "variants": ["UHJvZHVjdFZhcmlhbnQ6MzQ1=="]
  }
}
```
</TabItem>
</Tabs>

#### Remove Products
To remove products, categories, collections, or variants from a voucher, use the [`voucherCataloguesRemove`](api-reference/discounts/mutations/voucher-catalogues-remove.mdx) mutation. This mutation allows you to remove specific items from the voucher's catalog.


Here's an example of how to use the mutation:

<Tabs>
<TabItem value="Mutation">
```graphql
mutation VoucherCataloguesRemove($id: ID!, $input: CatalogueInput!) {
  voucherCataloguesRemove(id: $id, input: $input) {
    errors {
      field
      message
      code
    }
    voucher {
      id
      name
      products(first: 10) {
        edges {
          node {
            id
            name
          }
        }
      }
      categories(first: 10) {
        edges {
          node {
            id
            name
          }
        }
      }
      collections(first: 10) {
        edges {
          node {
            id
            name
          }
        }
      }
      variants(first: 10) {
        edges {
          node {
            id
            name
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

</TabItem>

<TabItem value={"Variables"}>
```json
{
  "id": "Vm91Y2hlcjo0OA==",
  "input": {
    "products": ["UHJvZHVjdDoxNTM=", "UHJvZHVjdDoxNjc="],
    "categories": ["Q2F0ZWdvcnk6MjU="],
    "collections": ["Q29sbGVjdGlvbjo5"],
    "variants": ["UHJvZHVjdFZhcmlhbnQ6MzQ1=="]
  }
}
```
</TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Webhooks

All voucher actions also generate asynchronous webhooks that can be used for reacting
to the events emitted by Saleor, e.g. `VOUCHER_CREATED`, `VOUCHER_UPDATED`, `VOUCHER_DELETED`.
The [`WebhookEventTypeAsyncEnum`](/api-reference/webhooks/enums/webhook-event-type-async-enum.mdx#values)
represents the full list of asynchronous webhooks.

You can learn more about webhooks [here](developer/extending/webhooks/asynchronous-events.mdx).

## Exporting Voucher Codes

Voucher codes can be exported to a CSV or XLSX file.

You can learn more about voucher codes export [here](developer/export/export-voucher-codes.mdx).
