# Using AI with Saleor

:::note
Saleor doesn't share any data to AI vendors.
:::

## Model Context Protocol (MCP)

To help AI agents properly interact with Saleor, you can use the Model Context Protocol, which can interact with Saleor by understanding the GraphQL schema.

To configure your compatible IDE / editor to use the MCP, you can use the following configuration:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "mcp-saleor": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["mcp-graphql"],
      "env": {
        "SCHEMA":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/saleor/saleor/3.20/saleor/graphql/schema.graphql"
      }
    }
  }
}

```

Note that the `SCHEMA` includes the Saleor version.

Example MCP configurations for popular editors:
- VS Code: `.vscode/mcp.json` - [docs](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/copilot/chat/mcp-servers)
- Cursor: `.cursor/mcp.json` - [docs](https://docs.cursor.com/context/model-context-protocol#configuration-locations)
- [JetBrains IDE](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/ai-assistant/configure-an-mcp-server.html)
