# Using AI with Saleor

:::note
Saleor doesn't share any data to AI vendors.
:::

## Model Context Protocol (MCP)

To help AI agents properly interact with Saleor, you can use the Model Context Protocol, which can interact with Saleor by understanding the GraphQL schema.

To configure your compatible IDE / editor to use the MCP, you can use the following configuration:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "mcp-saleor": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["mcp-graphql"],
      "env": {
        "SCHEMA": "/path/to/local/schema.graphql"
      }
    }
  }
}

```

You can download the full Saleor GraphQL schema from the following URL: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/saleor/saleor/3.21/saleor/graphql/schema.graphql

Note: The URL includes the specific Saleor version (3.21) in the path. To reference a different version, adjust the URL accordingly.

Example MCP configurations for popular editors:

- Cursor: `.cursor/mcp.json` - [docs](https://docs.cursor.com/context/model-context-protocol#configuration-locations)
