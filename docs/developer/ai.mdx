# Using AI with Saleor

## Model Context protocol (MCP)

To help AI agents properly interact with Saleor, you can use the Model Context Protocol, which can interact with Saleor by understanding graphQL schema.

To configure your compatible IDE / editor to use the MCP, you can use the following configuration:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "mcp-saleor": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["mcp-graphql"],
      "env": {
        "SCHEMA":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/saleor/saleor/3.20/saleor/graphql/schema.graphql"
      }
    }
  }
}

```

Note that the `SCHEMA` includes the Saleor version.
