description: When to use Attributes and when metadata. Do you need both?

Saleor uses both Attributes and Metadata in various places. Attributes have a strict structure with data types, validation, schema etc. Metadata is a simple `key: value` structure without types. You might wonder, do we need both? Or which should I use where?

### Attributes vs. Metadata difference

:::note
TL;DR: Attributes are for people, metadata are for apps.
:::

Attributes:

- intended to be filled in by people
- strictly typed
- the schema is strict so that the storefront can depend on this value being of a specific shape e.g. a field for number of pages will not contain a photo of jeans
- attributes are typically used in the UI layer, presented to customers, merchandisers, or admins

Metadata:

- intended to be filled by an app, an automation or integration through the API
- validation should happen in unit tests of the app
- metadata has no schema so that it doesn’t require a human to change how the code is operating with them
