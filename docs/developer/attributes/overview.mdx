### Product and Content Types

Type is a collection of attributes that make up a shape of data of a product or a content block.

### Reusable attributes

Each attribute configuration is reusable across different product types which can be convenient when you have to manage them across multiple products.

For example attribute **T-shirt Size** might have range of values **S - L** where is attribute **Shoe Size** have **34-46**, therefore they can be used in different product types without creating attribute from scratch in each flavor of Shoe or T-shirt product type.

Using dropdown attributes can also help to maintain consistency across the store.
