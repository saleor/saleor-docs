An attribute is a reusable field that can be assigned to a product or a variant, similar to fields in a CMS.

Here is an overview of all possible attribute types:

| Name            | Description                                                                                  | Example                                                                                      |
| --------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Dropdown**    | List of predefined choices; rendered as a single-select dropdown.                            | Store a color of a variant with predefined choices: orange, black, blue, etc.                |
| **Multiselect** | List of predefined choices; rendered as a multi-select dropdown.                             | Add multiple tags to a product or a page.                                                    |
| **File**        | Allows to store a file as an attribute value; rendered as a file input.                      | Store a product manual as a PDF file; store a hero image for a page.                         |
| **Reference**   | Values are references to other entities such as products, variants or pages.                 | Render a list of related products on a product page.                                         |
| **Numeric**     | Values are numbers; optionally, a unit can be provided to represent measures and dimensions. | Dimensions of a product represented with three numeric attributes: length, width, and depth. |
| **Rich text**   | Value is stored as rich-text content; rendered as a rich-text editor.                        | Additional content blocks for a page or product.                                             |
| **Plain text**  | Value is stored as plain text; rendered as a text input.                                     | Stores unformatted text for simple labels, e.g., "Material: 100% Cotton"                     |
| **Swatch**      | Stores a color code or an image.                                                             | Stores a color or an image to visually represent options like colors or patterns.            |
| **Boolean**     | Allows storing boolean values.                                                               | Yes/no properties, e.g., "Product is fair trade certified: yes/no".                          |

| **Date time**   | Allows storing date-time values.                                                             | Store release date with the time of a product.                                               |

## Product and Content Types

A type is a collection of attributes that make up the shape of data in a product or a content block.

## Reusable attributes

Each attribute configuration is reusable across different product types, which is convenient when managing them across multiple products.

For example attribute **T-shirt Size** might have range of values **S - L** where is attribute **Shoe Size** have **34-46**, therefore they can be used in different product types without creating attribute from scratch in each flavor of Shoe or T-shirt product type.

Using dropdown attributes can also help to maintain consistency across the store.

## Attributes vs. Metadata Difference

Saleor uses both Attributes and [Metadata](/api-usage/metadata.mdx) in various places. Attributes have a strict structure with data types, validation, schema etc. Metadata is a simple `key: value` structure without types. You might wonder, do we need both? Or which should I use where?

Attributes:

- intended to be filled in by people
- strictly typed
- the schema is strict so that the storefront can depend on this value being of a specific shape e.g. a field for number of pages will not contain a photo of jeans
- attributes are typically used in the UI layer, presented to customers, merchandisers, or admins

Metadata:

- intended to be filled by an app, an automation or integration through the API
- validation should happen in unit tests of the app
- metadata has no schema so that it doesn’t require a human to change how the code is operating with them
