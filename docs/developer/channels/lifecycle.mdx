### Channels lifecycle

Your store will have a default channel that can be deleted, but at least one channel is always required.
Channels have single currency and can not be changed after creation.

#### Creation

Channels are assigned to a single currency during creation and can not be changed afterward.

#### Activation

Channels can be activated and deactivated, affecting the channel's discoverability by the front end, which can be useful during the configuration phase.

#### Removal

You must first migrate the existing orders to a channel with the same currency to remove a channel.
