## Steps to create a channel

1. Create a new channel in configuration.
2. Assign it to shipping zones to make shipping rates available.
3. Assign it to warehouses to make stock available.
4. Add price to product variants in the newly created channel and set availability.
5. Make channel active.

## Settings

[//]: # "(todo add more details on what default country affects)"

- **Currency**: Can be assigned only to a single currency, and it can not be changed.
- **Default country**: When products are queried, the default country is used to determine the stock availability of the product.
- **Allocation strategy**: Determines the rules on which warehouse is picked for stock reservation and allocation, [learn more](developer/stock/stock-allocation.mdx#allocation-strategies).
- **Warehouse**: Assign warehouses that would be used for fulfillment.
- **Shipping zones**: Channel can be assigned to multiple shipping zones.
- **Status**: Channel can have different permissions for admin users.
- **Order expiration**: Set how long the order will be valid.
- **Slug:** Channel slug is used to query the channel. Some web shops might use it as part of the URL.
- **Channel name**: Name of the channel, intended for internal use but can be also made public via API.
- **Allow unpaid orders**: [learn more](#allow-unpaid-orders)
- **Authorization**: When authorization mode is enabled, checkout payments will be authorized but not captured, this means that capturing process would need to be done manually in the dashboard or via API after the order is created.

### Allow unpaid orders

The following mutations would allow to create orders without payment:

[checkoutComplete](api-reference/checkout/mutations/checkout-complete.mdx)

[orderMarkAsPaid](api-reference/orders/mutations/order-mark-as-paid.mdx)

Which means the admins would also be able to create orders without payment via the dashboard.

:::warning
Allow unpaid order setting is only compatible with Transaction API.
It should not be used with Payments API (e.g. Stripe plugin is not going to work).

### Exemplary setup

Here is how configuration of a business with many markets would look like:

- `EU` channel. Currency: EUR. Warehouse: Germany. Countries: NL, DE, FR, BE, PT, ES, IT, AT
- `IRELAND` channel. Currency: EUR. Warehouse: UK, Germany. Because of higher shipping costs and operational costs, new channel is introduced with higher prices and different stock availability.
- `UK` channel. Currency: GBP. Warehouse: UK. Countries: UK
- `US` channel. Currency: USD. Warehouse: US. Countries: US, CA, MX. Business operates only in USD in North America and has same product price for all countries, shipping is adjusted per country differently.
- `B2B` wholesale channel. Currency: USD. Warehouse: Germany, US. Countries: JP, KR, AU. Business operates in USD for wholesale customers in Asia and Australia.
- `Sister brand` channel. Currency: USD. Warehouse: US. Countries: US, CA, MX. Channel for separate storefront selling different line of product under different brand.
