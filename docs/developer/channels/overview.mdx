Sales channels allow you to model your data across different regions, brands, and business models where data can be customized and shared across channels. Channels enable you to serve different customers and markets from a **single backend** instance.

### Relationships and scope

Adding a channel creates extensive customization options. Below is the degree of customization per entity:

| Entity               | Degree of customization per channel                                               |
| :------------------- | :-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Checkout**         | Contextualized to a channel to display the appropriate stock, prices, taxes, etc. |
| **Product**          | Control visibility, availability, search, publication date                        |
| **Variants**         | Control availability and price                                                    |
| **Taxes**            | Control calculation methods, gross or net, country exceptions                     |
| **Vouchers**         | Control availability, discount values, rules                                      |
| **Orders**           | Contextualized to the channel and require channel permission for access.          |
| **Promotions**       | Control availability, rules, and pricing                                          |
| **Payment flow**     | Settings for authorization, payment conditions, expiration, etc.                  |
| **Currency**         | Channel belongs to a single currency.                                             |
| **Warehouses**       | Availability                                                                      |
| **Permission group** | Assigned to channels to control access to sensitive data                          |
| **Shipping rates**   | Availability, price, order total conditions                                       |
| **Shipping zones**   | Availability                                                                      |

### How Channels are used

- **Multiple geographical markets:** Each market has different prices, taxes, shipping options, stock availability, back-office integrations, etc.

- **B2B and B2C:** Customer types can map to channels to grant exclusive prices and services.

- **Different Legal Entities:** Businesses with different legal entities can restrict access to customer and order data per entity.

- **Distribution channels:** Serving physical and online channels.

- **Multi-brand:** Businesses that want to share customer data, loyalty programs, and products but maintain separate order data.

- **A/B testing:** Testing different pricing strategies for products and fulfillment.

- **External channels:** Create dedicated channels for marketplaces or other sales platforms.

### Not ideal for

- Dynamic Currency conversion. Each channel can have a different currency; however, `Checkout` belongs to a single channel, so converting to another channel would not be straightforward. Each channel can have different stock, prices, taxes, etc.

- Customer-specific pricing. You could potentially serve customers differently using channels, but note that each channel adds configuration complexity. See [relationships and scope](#relationships-and-scope) for more details.

- Supplier-specific pricing. If you want to sell a single product at different prices depending on the supplier, using channels would not work because each checkout is scoped to a single channel. You would need to implement price list functionality instead. See [example repository](https://github.com/saleor/saleor-app-checkout-prices).

### Channel access control

Admin access to order data can be configured at the channel level. This is useful for businesses with different legal entities that should not have access to each other's data.

Other objects such as products, vouchers, and shipping can belong to multiple channels at once, so their permissions are not scoped per channel to avoid complexity.
