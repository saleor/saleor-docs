This guide describes how to obtain products from the Saleor GraphQL API.

You can either retrieve a single product or a list of products. You may require a list of products in many situations, for example, when you need to display the catalog in your storefront or to provide a third-party service with a list of products available in your store.

## Multiple channels and products

Customers can only fetch products from available channels. Because listing channels is only available for staff users, you will need to provide channel slugs to your storefront.
Besides availability, you can define more parameters on a channel basis using [`ProductChannelListing`](api-reference/products/objects/product-channel-listing.mdx):

- `publicationDate`
- `isPublished`
- `visibleInListings`
- `availableForPurchase`
- `isAvailableForPurchase`

For variants, there's [`ProductVariantChannelListing`](api-reference/products/objects/product-variant-channel-listing.mdx):

- `price`
- `costPrice`
- `margin`

[Learn more about using multiple channels](developer/channels/overview.mdx).

## Retrieving a list of products

To fetch a product list, you need to run the `products` query. The `products` field is a paginated collection, see [Pagination](api-usage/pagination.mdx) for more information.

Let's take a look at an example query to fetch a list of products:

```graphql
{
  products(first: 2, channel: "default-channel") {
    edges {
      node {
        id
        name
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Response:

```json
{
  "data": {
    "products": {
      "edges": [
        {
          "node": {
            "id": "UHJvZHVjdDo3Mg==",
            "name": "Apple Juice"
          }
        },
        {
          "node": {
            "id": "UHJvZHVjdDo3NA==",
            "name": "Banana Juice"
          }
        }
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

In this example, for each product, we want to return the following fields:

- `id`: the unique product ID, most operations will require one.
- `name`: the name of the product.

The `channel` argument can be skipped only if a user has `is_staff` flag.

### Filtering

The [`products`](api-reference/products/queries/products.mdx) query gives the ability to filter the results. Use the optional [`filter`](api-reference/products/inputs/product-filter-input.mdx) argument. Some of the filters that are available here are:

:::tip
For advanced search capabilities, explore the [Saleor Search App](/developer/app-store/apps/search).
:::

- `search: String`: search by name or part of the description using built-in full-text search. 
- `price: ...`: filter by base price:
  - `price: {lte: Float}`: price lower than or equal to a given value.
  - `price: {gte: Float}`: price greater than or equal to a given value.
- `minimalPrice: ...`: filter by minimal variant price:
  - `minimalPrice: {lte: Float}`: price lower than or equal to a given value.
  - `minimalPrice: {gte: Float}`: price greater than or equal to a given value.
- `stockAvailability: ...`: filter by available stock:
  - `stockAvailability: IN_STOCK`: only available products.
  - `stockAvailability: OUT_OF_STOCK`: only out-of-stock products.

Here is an example query that looks for the first three products containing the term "juice" in the title or description:

```graphql
{
  products(first: 3, channel: "default-channel", filter: { search: "juice" }) {
    edges {
      node {
        name
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Response:

```json
{
  "data": {
    "products": {
      "edges": [
        {
          "node": {
            "name": "Apple Juice"
          }
        },
        {
          "node": {
            "name": "Banana Juice"
          }
        },
        {
          "node": {
            "name": "Bean Juice"
          }
        }
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

### Sorting

In [`products`](api-reference/products/queries/products.mdx) you can also sort the results using two [`sortBy`](api-reference/products/inputs/product-order.mdx) arguments:

- `field`: the field to use for sorting the results from several predefined choices:

  - `NAME`: sort products by name.
  - `PRICE`: sort products by base price.
  - `MINIMAL_PRICE`: sort products by minimal variant price.
  - `DATE`: sort products by last update.
  - `TYPE`: sort products by product type.
  - `PUBLISHED`: sort products by publication status.
  - `PUBLICATION_DATE`: sort products by publication date.
  - `PUBLISHED_AT`: sort products by publication date.
  - `LAST_MODIFIED_AT`: sort products by update date.
  - `RATING`: sort products by rating.
  - `CREATED_AT`: sort products by creation date.

- `direction`: The direction for sorting items:
  - `ASC`: sort ascending.
  - `DESC`: sort descending.

This example shows how to sort the products list by the minimal variant price, lowest to highest:

```graphql
{
  products(
    first: 2
    channel: "default-channel"
    sortBy: { field: MINIMAL_PRICE, direction: ASC }
  ) {
    edges {
      node {
        name
        pricing {
          priceRange {
            start {
              gross {
                amount
                currency
              }
            }
            stop {
              gross {
                amount
                currency
              }
            }
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Response:

```json
{
  "data": {
    "products": {
      "edges": [
        {
          "node": {
            "name": "Blue Hoodie",
            "pricing": {
              "priceRange": {
                "start": {
                  "gross": {
                    "amount": 1.6,
                    "currency": "USD"
                  }
                },
                "stop": {
                  "gross": {
                    "amount": 2.6,
                    "currency": "USD"
                  }
                }
              }
            }
          }
        },
        {
          "node": {
            "name": "Banana Juice",
            "pricing": {
              "priceRange": {
                "start": {
                  "gross": {
                    "amount": 1.99,
                    "currency": "USD"
                  }
                },
                "stop": {
                  "gross": {
                    "amount": 2.99,
                    "currency": "USD"
                  }
                }
              }
            }
          }
        }
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

### Get a product by ID

The following query retrieves the product with the associated ID. It returns the product fields specified in the query.

| Query arguments |                                                          |
| --------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| id: ID!         | The ID of the product to return                          |
| channel: String | Slug of a channel for which the data should be returned. |

```graphql title="Query"
{
  product(id: "UHJvZHVjdDoxOTg=", channel: "default-channel") {
    id
    name
  }
}
```

```json title="Response"
{
  "data": {
    "product": {
      "id": "UHJvZHVjdDoxOTg=",
      "name": "ABBA Again"
    }
  },
  "extensions": {
    "cost": {
      "requestedQueryCost": 1,
      "maximumAvailable": 50000
    }
  }
}
```

## Retrieving product variants

To obtain product variants, query the `variants` field on the `Product` type:

```graphql
{
  products(first: 1, channel: "default-channel") {
    edges {
      node {
        id
        name
        variants {
          id
          name
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Response:

```json
{
  "data": {
    "products": {
      "edges": [
        {
          "node": {
            "id": "UHJvZHVjdDoxMzc=",
            "name": "Blue Polygon Shirt",
            "variants": [
              {
                "id": "UHJvZHVjdFZhcmlhbnQ6MzYx",
                "name": "M"
              },
              {
                "id": "UHJvZHVjdFZhcmlhbnQ6MzYy",
                "name": "L"
              },
              {
                "id": "UHJvZHVjdFZhcmlhbnQ6MzYz",
                "name": "XL"
              }
            ]
          }
        }
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

Like products, here we're asking for two fields from each variant:

- `id`: the unique variant ID.
- `name`: the name of the variant.

## Pricing

Use the `pricing` field of products and variants to obtain pricing information.

Here are the available fields for product pricing:

```graphql
type ProductPricingInfo {
  priceRange: TaxedMoneyRange
  priceRangeUndiscounted: TaxedMoneyRange
  discount: TaxedMoney
  onSale: Boolean
}
```

And similar fields for product variants:

```graphql
type VariantPricingInfo {
  price: TaxedMoney
  priceUndiscounted: TaxedMoney
  discount: TaxedMoney
  onSale: Boolean
}
```

The main difference is that products don't have a price point. Instead, they offer a price range that includes all their variant prices.

Here are the money types returned by the above:

```graphql
type TaxedMoneyRange {
  # lowest price
  start: TaxedMoney
  # highest price
  stop: TaxedMoney
}

type TaxedMoney {
  # before tax
  net: Money!
  # after tax
  gross: Money!

  # gross - net
  tax: Money!
  # repeated for convenience
  currency: String!
}

type Money {
  amount: Float!
  currency: String!
}
```

See [Prices](api-usage/prices.mdx) for more information about money types.

### Fetching prices with tax rates specific to a country

You can fetch prices including taxes specific to a country. To do that, pass the `address` parameter in the `pricing` field, including the country code for which the tax should be calculated. The `address` parameter is available in the `Product.pricing` and `ProductVariant.pricing` fields.

In the example below, we fetch the price of a product variant for Poland, where the standard VAT rate is 23%:

```graphql {3}
{
  productVariant(id: "UHJvZHVjdFZhcmlhbnQ6MjAz", channel: "default-channel") {
    pricing(address: { country: PL }) {
      price {
        net {
          amount
        }
        gross {
          amount
        }
        tax {
          amount
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Result:

```json
{
  "data": {
    "productVariant": {
      "pricing": {
        "price": {
          "net": {
            "amount": 5
          },
          "gross": {
            "amount": 6.15
          },
          "tax": {
            "amount": 1.15
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

The tax equals 1.15, which is 23% of the net price. The gross price is the sum of the net price and the tax.

:::note
The `address` parameter is optional. If it's not provided, Saleor will use the default country code configured in the backend settings (see [DEFAULT_COUNTRY](setup/configuration.mdx#default_country)).

## Stock availability for customers

Stock availability of products is defined for each variant and warehouse. There are two fields that allow you to fetch the stock information in the public API.

To fetch the stock availability, use the `Product.isAvailable` field:

```graphql {4}
{
  product(id: "UHJvZHVjdDo3Mg==", channel: "default-channel") {
    name
    isAvailable(address: { country: US })
  }
}
```

Result:

```json
{
  "data": {
    "product": {
      "name": "Apple Juice",
      "isAvailable": true
    }
  }
}
```

The `address` parameter checks the quantity in a warehouse connected with a shipping zone that includes the given address. If not provided, Saleor will use a warehouse with the highest available quantity.

The `isAvailable` field is `True` when:

- There is at least one variant for which the stock quantity minus the allocated quantity is above zero (in a warehouse matching the given address).
- The product is published in the given channel and available for purchase.

To fetch the available quantity, use the `ProductVariant.quantityAvailable` field:

```graphql {3}
{
  productVariant(id: "UHJvZHVjdFZhcmlhbnQ6MjAz", channel: "default-channel") {
    quantityAvailable(address: { country: US })
  }
}
```

Response:

```json
{
  "data": {
    "productVariant": {
      "quantityAvailable": 30
    }
  }
}
```

A warehouse is chosen based on the argument `address`. If the argument is omitted, API will return the highest available quantity.

:::note
To avoid leaking precise stock information, the `quantityAvailable` field will not be greater than the maximum orderable threshold configured in the [`MAX_CHECKOUT_LINE_QUANTITY`](setup/configuration.mdx#max_checkout_line_quantity) server setting.
:::

## Stock quantities

For creating integrations with an external stock management system, you will need to use stock values not restricted by [`MAX_CHECKOUT_LINE_QUANTITY`](setup/configuration.mdx#max_checkout_line_quantity).

:::note
`stocks` field in the [`ProductVariant`](api-reference/products/objects/product-variant.mdx) object require `MANAGE_PRODUCTS` permission.
:::

To clarify the difference between `quantityAvailable` and stocks, we will query both for the product variant:

Request:

```graphql {3,8-9}
query {
  productVariant(id: "UHJvZHVjdFZhcmlhbnQ6MjAz", channel: "default-channel") {
    quantityAvailable
    stocks {
      warehouse {
        slug
      }
      quantity
      quantityAllocated
    }
  }
}
```

Response:

```json {4,10-11,17-18}
{
  "data": {
    "productVariant": {
      "quantityAvailable": 50,
      "stocks": [
        {
          "warehouse": {
            "slug": "europe"
          },
          "quantity": 111,
          "quantityAllocated": 0
        },
        {
          "warehouse": {
            "slug": "americas"
          },
          "quantity": 113,
          "quantityAllocated": 0
        }
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

- The `quantityAvailable` is a sum of stock quantities from all available stocks.
  In this case, the sum is higher than the `MAX_CHECKOUT_LINE_QUANTITY`, so the maximum
  value of 50 products is returned.
- `stocks` contain a full list of stock quantities in each warehouse.

:::note
When the product has the track inventory turned off, the `quantityAvailable` will always
be equal to the `MAX_CHECKOUT_LINE_QUANTITY` value.
:::

### Getting the available quantity for the particular address

The quantity available can be fetched for the given address. The returned quantity
is the sum of the quantity from all stocks that are available in the shipping zone that
supports the provided address. When the address is not provided, the highest quantity
from available shipping zones is returned.

To get the `quantityAvailable` for a particular address use the `address` parameter:
Request:

```graphql {3-5}
query {
    productVariant(id: "UHJvZHVjdFZhcmlhbnQ6MjAz", channel: "default-channel") {
    quantityAvailable(
      address: {"country": "US"}
    )
    stocks {
      warehouse {
        slug
      }
      quantity
      quantityAllocated
    }
  }
}
```

Response:

```json {4,10-11,17-18}
{
  "data": {
    "productVariant": {
      "quantityAvailable": 20,
      "stocks": [
        {
          "warehouse": {
            "slug": "europe"
          },
          "quantity": 30,
          "quantityAllocated": 0
        },
        {
          "warehouse": {
            "slug": "americas"
          },
          "quantity": 20,
          "quantityAllocated": 0
        }
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

In the response, we get the available quantity of 20 as the `americas` is the only
warehouse available in the `US`.

In the case when the address is not provided, the quantity for the shipping zone with
the highest available quantity is returned.

### Handling collection point warehouses in the quantity calculations

The collection point warehouses are treated as a single-warehouse shipping zone.

- In the case of a local collection point warehouse, the calculated quantity will equal
  the quantity of this local warehouse.
- In the case of a global collection point warehouse the quantity will equal the sum
  of available quantity from all stocks that are available in the provided country code
  and channel. When the country is not provided the quantity will be the sum of quantities
  from all stocks that are available in the given channel, regardless of the shipping zone.

## Media

Product media are images or videos associated with products and used to render product galleries. The `Product` type contains two fields that refer to its media:

- `thumbnail: Image`: the product's main image. If the first media file for a product is a video, a video thumbnail is returned. An optional `size` parameter specifies the desired size in pixels if provided. The following fields are available:

  - `url: String!`: the image's URL.
  - `alt: String`: the alternative text to include when displaying the image.

- `media: [ProductMedia!]`: gives you access to the entire list of associated product media with the following fields available:
  - `type: ProductMediaType!`: the type of media file - `IMAGE` or `VIDEO`
  - `url: String!`: the media URL. For images, an optional `size` parameter specifies the desired size in pixels if provided.
  - `alt: String`: the alternative text to include when displaying the media file.
  - `oembedData: JSONString!`: embedded representation of a video URL, returned in the [oEmbed](https://oembed.com/) format.

Here's a query that asks for both the thumbnail and all media of the first product, optimized for display at 100×100px:

```graphql
{
  products(first: 1, channel: "default-channel") {
    edges {
      node {
        id
        name
        thumbnail(size: 100) {
          url
        }
        media {
          type
          url(size: 100)
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Response:

```json
{
  "data": {
    "products": {
      "edges": [
        {
          "node": {
            "id": "UHJvZHVjdDo3Mg==",
            "name": "Apple Juice",
            "thumbnail": {
              "url": "https://example.saleor.io/media/__sized__/products/saleordemoproduct_fd_juice_06-thumbnail-120x120.png"
            },
            "media": [
              {
                "type": "IMAGE",
                "url": "https://example.saleor.io/media/__sized__/products/saleordemoproduct_fd_juice_06-thumbnail-120x120.png"
              },
              {
                "type": "VIDEO",
                "url": "https://youtu.be/yPYZpwSpKmA"
              }
            ]
          }
        }
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

## Products Query Example

Here's a more complex GraphQL query that combines all of the above information:

```graphql
{
  products(
    first: 2
    channel: "default-channel"
    sortBy: { field: NAME, direction: ASC }
  ) {
    edges {
      node {
        id
        name
        pricing {
          priceRange {
            start {
              gross {
                amount
                currency
              }
            }
          }
          discount {
            gross {
              amount
              currency

## Create Products

:::info  
To create products and variants, you need the `MANAGE_PRODUCTS` permission.  
::: 

Before you can create a product, ensure the following exist:

- Product Type – Defines whether the product is shippable (physical vs. digital) and which attributes (e.g., size, color) it supports.
- Category – Organizes products into a hierarchical tree structure, often used for navigation in the storefront (e.g., "Clothing > Men > Shirts").
- Collection (Optional) – Groups products for marketing purposes or curated storefront sections (e.g., “Summer Sale” or “Best Sellers”).
- Channel – Controls the product's visibility, availability, pricing, and publication status across different sales channels (e.g., online store, marketplace).
- Warehouse – Required to track stock levels and assign inventory to product variants.

### Step-by-Step: Creating a Product and Variant

1. [`productCreate`](/api-reference/products/mutations/product-create)
  Creates the base product with core fields: name, description, product type, category, etc.

```graphql
mutation ProductCreate {
  productCreate(
    input: {
      name: "T-Shirt", 
      description: "{\"blocks\":[{\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"data\":{\"text\":\"A comfortable cotton t-shirt\"}}]}", 
      productType: "UHJvZHVjdFR5cGU6MjA=", 
      category: "Q2F0ZWdvcnk6Mzk=", 
      attributes: [{id: "QXR0cmlidXRlOjM2", values: ["cotton"]}]}
  ) {
    product {
      id
      name
      description
    }
    errors {
      field
      message
    }
  }
}
```

2. [`productChannelListingUpdate`](/api-reference/products/mutations/product-channel-listing-update)
  Assigns the product to one or more sales channels. This step is necessary to:
    - Publish the product
    - Define if it's available for purchase

```graphql
mutation ProductChannelListing {
  productChannelListingUpdate(
    id: "UHJvZHVjdDoxNzQ="
    input: {
      updateChannels: {
        channelId: "Q2hhbm5lbDox", 
        isPublished: true, 
        visibleInListings: true, 
        isAvailableForPurchase: true
      }
    }
  ) {
    product {
      id
    }
    errors {
      field
      message
    }
  }
}
```

:::tip  
You can create variants individually or in bulk, depending on your use case:
  - Single variant creation: Use the mutation steps below.
  - Bulk variant creation: See [Create variants in bulk](/developer/bulks/bulk-products.mdx#productvariantbulkupdate).
:::

3. [`productVariantCreate`](/api-reference/products/mutations/product-variant-create)
  Creates a variant for the product. Variants are required even if your product has no variations – this is how Saleor handles SKUs, pricing, and inventory.
	
```graphql
mutation VariantCreate{
  productVariantCreate(input: {
    product: "UHJvZHVjdDoxNzQ="
    sku: "128223592"
    attributes: [
    {
      id: "QXR0cmlidXRlOjM4",
      values: [
        "M"
      ]
    }
  ]
  }) {
    productVariant {
      id
      name
    }
    errors {
      field
      message
    }
  }
}
```

4. [`productVariantChannelListingUpdate`](/api-reference/products/mutations/product-variant-channel-listing-update)
    Sets prices for the variant per channel. Without this, variants won't appear in the storefront or checkout.

:::info  
  In Saleor, price and inventory are stored at the variant level to allow multi-variant products (e.g., sizes or colors) to have unique pricing and stock. Even single-variant products follow this structure for consistency.
:::

```graphql
mutation VariantChannelListing {
  productVariantChannelListingUpdate(
    id: "UHJvZHVjdFZhcmlhbnQ6NDQy"
    input: [{channelId: "Q2hhbm5lbDox", price: 19.99, costPrice: 5}]
  ) {
    variant {
      id
    }
    errors {
      field
      message
    }
  }
}
```

5. [`productVariantStocksCreate`](/api-reference/products/mutations/product-variant-stocks-create)
    Links the variant to a warehouse and sets stock quantities.

```graphql
mutation VariantStocksCreate {
  productVariantStocksCreate(
    variantId: "UHJvZHVjdFZhcmlhbnQ6NDQy"
    stocks: [
      {warehouse: "V2FyZWhvdXNlOjc1MjYwYWRjLTJjZjAtNGQ0ZC1hOTM5LTBmZGY2Y2FlYjBjMQ==", quantity: 100}]
  ) {
    productVariant {
      id
    }
    errors {
      field
      message
    }
  }
}
```


### Managing Media

[`productMediaCreate`](/api-reference/products/mutations/product-media-create) – Creates a media object (image or external URL) associated with a product.

  - For image uploads, this mutation must be sent as a multipart request. See the spec: [graphql-multipart-request-spec](https://github.com/jaydenseric/)
  - For external URLs, you can use the mediaUrl field.

Creating product media with an external image URL example:

```graphql
mutation ProductMediaCreate{
  productMediaCreate(input: {
    product: "UHJvZHVjdDoxNzQ=",
    mediaUrl:"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4006792/214636328-8e4f83e8-66cb-4114-a3d8-473eb908b9c3.png",
    alt: "image description"
  
  }) {
    media {
      id
      url
    }
    errors {
      field
      message
    }
  }
}
```

[`variantMediaAssign`](/api-reference/products/mutations/variant-media-assign) – There is no dedicated upload mutation for variant media. Assign uploaded product media to specific variants (e.g., color-specific images).

```graphql 
mutation VariantMediaAssign {
  variantMediaAssign(
    mediaId: "UHJvZHVjdE1lZGlhOjU3"
    variantId: "UHJvZHVjdFZhcmlhbnQ6MzU0"
  ) {
    errors {
      field
      code
      message
    }
    media {
      id
      alt
    }
  }
}
```

[`productMediaReorder`](/api-reference/products/mutations/product-media-reorder) - Allows to change ordering of the product media.
 
```graphql
mutation MediaReorder {
  productMediaReorder(
    productId: "UHJvZHVjdDoxMzU="
    mediaIds: ["UHJvZHVjdE1lZGlhOjYw", "UHJvZHVjdE1lZGlhOjE5", "UHJvZHVjdE1lZGlhOjIw", "UHJvZHVjdE1lZGlhOjU3", "UHJvZHVjdE1lZGlhOjU4", "UHJvZHVjdE1lZGlhOjU5"]
  ) {
    errors {
      field
      code
      message
    }
    media {
      id
      sortOrder
    }
  }
}
```

[`productMediaUpdate`](/api-reference/products/mutations/product-media-update) Update media description

```graphql
mutation ProductMediaUpdate {
  productMediaUpdate(
    id: "UHJvZHVjdE1lZGlhOjYx"
    input: {alt: "updated media description"}
  ) {
    errors {
      field
      code
      message
    }
  }
}
```
