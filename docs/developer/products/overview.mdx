Products are the essential components of an order, and at least one product must exist to create a checkout or order. The table below outlines the business logic that products contain out of the box. Note that this functionality can be optional or customized based on your integration needs.

| Logic                   | Description                                                                                                                                 | Required/Optional/Customizable                                                                      |
| :---------------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | :-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Availability**        | Products are enabled per channel.                                                                                                           | Required.                                                                                           |
| **Taxes**               | Products can be assigned to specific tax classes with sales tax rules defined at the country and channel levels.                            | Optional and customizable. Taxes on order lines can be set by external services.                    |
| **Product information** | Product types define attributes (fields) that product data will hold.                                                                       | Optional. Product information can reside in external sources.                                       |
| **Catalog**             | Products can be linked to categories, collections, and other products or content blocks.                               | Optional. Can be managed externally, but organizing products in Saleor helps define promotions and price discounts. |
| **Variants**            | Variations of a product, such as color, size, material, or any user-defined dimension, mapped to a Stock Keeping Unit or unique slug. | Optional. A product can have one or many variants.                                                  |
| **Metadata**            | Storing arbitrary data about products, typically useful for custom integrations and business logic.                    | Optional.                                                                                           |

## Product and variants

Variants provide variations of the product, such as size, material, color, or any other user-defined dimension. If a product has no variants, you must create a product with a single variant because prices and stock can only be assigned at the variant level.

While configuring availability for both variants and products (especially for single-variant products) may seem redundant, this design is intentional. It provides greater control per variant and convenience when you have many variants and need to disable them all at once in a single channel.

It is possible to create products without variants, but checkout and orders can only contain variants.

| Level of control         | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          | Required/Optional/Customizable                                   |
| :----------------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | :--------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Price**                | The price is set at the channel level, which can have a dedicated currency. Prices can be set as Selling Prices intended for customers and Cost Prices, which are optional and only used for internal purposes.                                                      | Customizable. It can be overwritten on the checkout/order level. |
| **Availability**         | Variants inherit the product's availability and allow a finer level of control. For example, if the product is available in 2 out of 3 channels, then variant availability will be available in respective 2 channels.                                               | Required.                                                        |
| **Stock tracking**       | Automatic tracking that decrements stock after purchase.                                                                                                                                                                                                         | Optional.                                                        |
| **Attributes**           | Product types can define variant-specific attributes.                                                                                                                                                                                                            | Optional.                                                        |
| **Warehouse assignment** | Variants are mapped to unique SKUs that can belong to multiple warehouses.                                                                                                                                                                                       | Required for stock management.                                  |
| **Media**                | Images are inherited from the product. For example, if the product has images A, B, and C, any product image can be assigned to a specific variant. This allows the product to contain all images while variants point to specific relevant images. | Optional.                                                        |
| **Metadata**             | Storing arbitrary data about variants, typically useful for custom integrations and business logic.                                          | Optional.                                                         |

## Product types

Product type is a collection of [attributes](developer/attributes/overview.mdx) with different field types. For example, a _Product Type_ called **T-shirt** will have **Size**, **Material**, and **Length** attributes.

**Material:** can be _Cotton_ or _Polyester_ and represents a dropdown attribute assigned to a product type.

**Size:** is a product option that customers can select. It comes with predefined sizes, so it will be a _Dropdown_ type and _Variant selection attribute_.

**Length:** is an attribute specific to a variant. It is not customer-selectable and is unique to each product, so it will be a _Numeric_ type.
