## Introduction

Since version 3.0, Saleor has supported multiple sales channels. This feature allows the shop owner to configure many aspects of the store depending on the channel used.

- Your store needs at least one channel to display products
- You can add as many channels as you need
- Each channel has precisely one currency
- Channels can be deactivated for customers

Popular use cases:

- If you sell internationally, you can use separate channels for different currencies or regions
- If you want to have different prices in the custom mobile app and website, you can set up `website-channel` and `mobile-channel`

There are many models you can customize per channel. The details of which fields you can define on a per-channel basis are described in the `ChannelListing` models:

- [Collection](developer/api-reference/objects/collection-channel-listing.mdx)
- [Product](developer/api-reference/objects/product-channel-listing.mdx)
- [ProductVariant](developer/api-reference/objects/product-variant-channel-listing.mdx)
- [Sale](developer/api-reference/objects/sale-channel-listing.mdx)
- [ShippingMethod](developer/api-reference/objects/shipping-method-channel-listing.mdx)
- [Voucher](developer/api-reference/objects/voucher-channel-listing.mdx)

## Permissions

Listing channels is allowed only for users with the active [`isStaff`](developer/api-reference/objects/user.mdx#isstaff-boolean) flag.

You need the `MANAGE_CHANNELS` permission to create, edit, and remove channels.
Changing `ChannelListing` does not require additional permissions. For example, changing Product availability requires only `MANAGE_PRODUCTS` permission.

## Getting channel details

Use [`channel`](developer/api-reference/queries/channel.mdx) query to get channel details.

Available fields:

- `id`: Channel object ID
- `name`: Channel name
- `isActive`: Flag signalling that the channel is available for shop customers.
- `slug`: When using channel-dependant queries, the slug is used to select the right one (for example, when requesting Product details)
- `currencyCode`: Currency code used by the channel.
- `defaultCountry`: Default country for the channel. The default country will be used in checkout to determine the stock quantities or calculate taxes when the country was not explicitly provided, either as a query parameter or through a shipping address.
- `hasOrders`: Returns `true` when there are already created orders using that channel. If that's the only channel using this currency, you won't be able to remove it.
- `warehouses`: Warehouses that are available in the given channel.
- `stockSettings`: contains all stock-related settings, f.e. the allocation strategy for the channel.

Request:

```graphql
query {
  channel(id: "Q2hhbm5lbDo3") {
    id
    isActive
    name
    slug
    defaultCountry {
      code
      country
    }
    hasOrders
    warehouses {
      slug
    }
    stockSettings {
      allocationStrategy
    }
  }
}
```

Response:

```json
{
  "data": {
    "channel": {
      "id": "Q2hhbm5lbDo0MzM=",
      "isActive": false,
      "name": "Mobile",
      "slug": "mobile",
      "currencyCode": "USD",
      "defaultCountry": {
        "code": "US",
        "country": "United States of America"
      },
      "hasOrders": false
      "warehouses": [
        {
          "slug": "oceania"
        },
        {
          "slug": "europe"
        }
      ]
      "stockSettings": {
        "allocationStrategy": "PRIORITIZE_HIGH_STOCK"
      }
    }
  }
```

## Creating a new channel

You can create a new channel using [`channelCreate`](developer/api-reference/mutations/channel-create.mdx) mutation.
During checkout creation, you can define the allocation strategy. Right now the
two possible options are available: `PRIORITIZE_HIGH_STOCK` and `PRIORITIZE_SORTING_ORDER`,
the `PRIORITIZE_SORTING_ORDER` strategy is used as default.
You can read more about the allocation strategies [`here`](developer/stock-allocation.mdx#allocation-strategies).

Request:

```graphql
mutation {
  channelCreate(
    input: {
      currencyCode: "USD"
      defaultCountry: US
      name: "Mobile"
      slug: "mobile"
      stockSettings: { allocationStrategy: PRIORITIZE_HIGH_STOCK }
    }
  ) {
    channel {
      id
      isActive
      name
      slug
      currencyCode
      defaultCountry {
        code
        country
      }
      stockSettings {
        allocationStrategy
      }
    }
    errors {
      code
      field
      message
    }
  }
}
```

Response:

```json
{
  "data": {
    "channelCreate": {
      "channel": {
        "id": "Q2hhbm5lbDo0MzM=",
        "isActive": false,
        "name": "Mobile",
        "slug": "mobile",
        "currencyCode": "USD",
        "defaultCountry": {
          "code": "US",
          "country": "United States of America"
        },
        "stockSettings": {
          "allocationStrategy": "PRIORITIZE_HIGH_STOCK"
        }
      },
      "errors": []
    }
  }
}
```

### Channel list

Because some of the channels may be considered non-public (for example - a channel for business partners), non-staff users cannot use the [`channels`](developer/api-reference/queries/channels.mdx) query.

Request:

```graphql
query {
  channels {
    name
  }
}
```

Response:

```json
{
  "data": {
    "channels": [
      {
        "name": "Mobile"
      },
      {
        "name": "Website"
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

### Activate / Deactivate channel

If you want to make the channel unavailable for customers, you can change it's status to `deactivated` using [`channelDeactivate`](developer/api-reference/mutations/channel-deactivate.mdx) mutation:

```graphql
mutation {
  channelDeactivate(id: "Q2hhbm5lbDoxMQ==") {
    channel {
      name
      isActive
    }
    errors {
      message
    }
  }
}
```

Response:

```json
{
  "data": {
    "channelDeactivate": {
      "channel": {
        "name": "Facebook",
        "isActive": false
      },
      "channelErrors": []
    }
  }
}
```

And to reverse the previous operation use the [`channelActivate`](developer/api-reference/mutations/channel-activate.mdx) mutation:

```graphql
mutation {
  channelActivate(id: "Q2hhbm5lbDoxMQ==") {
    channel {
      name
      isActive
    }
    errors {
      message
    }
  }
}
```

Response:

```json
{
  "data": {
    "channelDeactivate": {
      "channel": {
        "name": "Facebook",
        "isActive": true
      },
      "channelErrors": []
    }
  }
}
```

## Reorder warehouses within channels

The warehouses assigned to the channel can be sorted. The provided order defines the
warehouses' order used in `PRIORITIZE_SORTING_ORDER` allocation strategy.
The `sort_order` in `moves` input represents the new relative position of the item.
So when 1 is provided the item will be moved one position forward, when -1 - the one
position backward.

Let's assume that we have a `channel` with three channels in the following order.

```json
{
  "data": {
    "channel": {
      "id": "Q2hhbm5lbDox",
      "warehouses": [
        {
          "id": "V2FyZWhvdXNlOjU1NTZiOWI0LTc1ZTItNGI3YS1hZWM1LTQxOTY4NDA2OGE4OA==",
          "slug": "europe"
        },
        {
          "id": "V2FyZWhvdXNlOjQwZWY1MTQwLWQ5OTYtNDVlNy04NzUzLTlkZThkMTdhMjg1Yw==",
          "slug": "oceania"
        },
        {
          "id": "V2FyZWhvdXNlOjY4M2FkMzZhLTRmNjktNDI2ZS1iYzUyLTMyZGJiZTQ2NjUyZA==",
          "slug": "americas"
        }
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

To move the `americas` warehouse to the first place and the `europe` warehouse to
third, we can run the following mutation.

```graphql
mutation {
  channelReorderWarehouses(
    channelId: "Q2hhbm5lbDox"
    moves: [
      {
        id: "V2FyZWhvdXNlOjY4M2FkMzZhLTRmNjktNDI2ZS1iYzUyLTMyZGJiZTQ2NjUyZA=="
        sortOrder: -2
      }
      {
        id: "V2FyZWhvdXNlOjU1NTZiOWI0LTc1ZTItNGI3YS1hZWM1LTQxOTY4NDA2OGE4OA=="
        sortOrder: 1
      }
    ]
  ) {
    channel {
      id
      warehouses {
        id
        slug
      }
    }
    errors {
      field
      code
      message
      warehouses
    }
  }
}
```

And as a response we get:

```json
{
  "data": {
    "channelReorderWarehouses": {
      "channel": {
        "id": "Q2hhbm5lbDox",
        "warehouses": [
          {
            "id": "V2FyZWhvdXNlOjY4M2FkMzZhLTRmNjktNDI2ZS1iYzUyLTMyZGJiZTQ2NjUyZA==",
            "slug": "americas"
          },
          {
            "id": "V2FyZWhvdXNlOjQwZWY1MTQwLWQ5OTYtNDVlNy04NzUzLTlkZThkMTdhMjg1Yw==",
            "slug": "oceania"
          },
          {
            "id": "V2FyZWhvdXNlOjU1NTZiOWI0LTc1ZTItNGI3YS1hZWM1LTQxOTY4NDA2OGE4OA==",
            "slug": "europe"
          }
        ]
      },
      "errors": []
    }
  }
}
```

## Removing a channel

Channels can be removed only when:

- There are no orders created in them.
- If there are orders created, `targetChannel` is required. Its currency has to be the same as the channel you are about to delete. All orders will be moved to `targetChannel`.

[`channelDelete`](developer/api-reference/mutations/channel-delete.mdx) mutation takes [input](developer/api-reference/inputs/channel-delete-input.mdx):

- `id`: ID of the Channel that will be deleted
- `targetChannel`: all existing orders will be moved into this channel

```graphql
channelDelete(
  id: ID!
  input: ChannelDeleteInput
): ChannelDelete

input ChannelDeleteInput {
  targetChannel: ID!
}
```

## Errors

```graphql
type ChannelError {
  field: String
  message: String
  code: ChannelErrorCode!
}

enum ChannelErrorCode {
  ALREADY_EXISTS
  GRAPHQL_ERROR
  INVALID
  NOT_FOUND
  REQUIRED
  UNIQUE
  CHANNEL_TARGET_ID_MUST_BE_DIFFERENT
  CHANNELS_CURRENCY_MUST_BE_THE_SAME
}
```

[`ChannelErrorCode`](developer/api-reference/enums/channel-error-code.mdx) values:

- `ALREADY_EXISTS`: Object already exists in the database
- `GRAPHQL_ERROR`: Wrong query
- `INVALID`: Invalid data provided
- `NOT_FOUND`: Could not found object
- `REQUIRED`: Missing required fields
- `UNIQUE`: Provided value for field needs to be unique
- `CHANNEL_TARGET_ID_MUST_BE_DIFFERENT`: Cannot move orders into the channel you want to delete
- `CHANNELS_CURRENCY_MUST_BE_THE_SAME`: Target channel has to have the same currency
