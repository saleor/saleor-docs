# Bulk Operations

Saleor provides a set of bulk mutations that allow you to efficiently 
create or update multiple objects in a single API call. These operations 
are particularly useful for data migration, system integration, or initial store setup.

## Available Bulk Mutations
### Attributes

The bulk attribute mutations enable you to create and update 
multiple attributes and their values in a single operation. 
This is particularly useful when setting up or modifying your product attribute structure.

- [`attributeBulkCreate`](/api-reference/attributes/mutations/attribute-bulk-create)
- [`attributeBulkUpdate`](/api-reference/attributes/mutations/attribute-bulk-update)

For detailed guidance and example payloads, see the [bulk attributes documentation](bulk-attributes).


### Customers

The [`customerBulkUpdate`](/api-reference/users/mutations/customer-bulk-update) mutation allows you to update multiple 
customer accounts simultaneously. This is useful for updating customer information, or status in bulk.

Before updating customers, ensure you have:
- Valid **customer IDs or external reference** for all records being updated
- Address formats validated for your target regions

### Orders

Saleor offers the [`orderBulkCreate`](/api-reference/orders/mutations/order-bulk-create) mutation to facilitate the import 
of multiple orders simultaneously, which is particularly useful when 
migrating data from external systems.

For detailed guidance and example payloads, see the [bulk orders guide](bulk-orders).

### Products and Variants

Saleor provides three bulk mutations to help you manage products and variants at scale. These are ideal for initializing large catalogs, synchronizing data from external systems, or performing mass updates efficiently:

- [`productBulkCreate`](/api-reference/products/mutations/product-bulk-create): Create multiple products along with their variants, attributes, and channel listings.
- [`productVariantBulkCreate`](/api-reference/products/mutations/product-variant-bulk-create): Create multiple variants for existing products in a single mutation.
- [`productVariantBulkUpdate`](/api-reference/products/mutations/product-variant-bulk-update): Update attributes, pricing, and inventory details for multiple variants at once.

For detailed guidance and example payloads, see the [bulk products documentation](bulk-products).

### Stock Management

The [`stockBulkUpdate`](/api-reference/products/mutations/stock-bulk-update) mutation enables you to update stock levels across 
multiple warehouses in a single operation. This is useful for inventory 
synchronization and bulk stock adjustments.

For detailed guidance and example payloads, see the [bulk stock update documentation](bulk-stock).


### Translations

Bulk translation mutations allow you to manage translations 
for multiple products, variants, attributes, and values in a single operation.
 This is essential for maintaining multilingual catalogs.

- [`productBulkTranslate`](/api-reference/products/mutations/product-bulk-translate)
- [`productVariantBulkTranslate`](/api-reference/products/mutations/product-variant-bulk-translate)
- [`attributeBulkTranslate`](/api-reference/attributes/mutations/attribute-bulk-translate)
- [`attributeValueBulkTranslate`](/api-reference/attributes/mutations/attribute-value-bulk-translate)
- [`promotionRuleTranslate`](/api-reference/discounts/mutations/promotion-rule-translate)

Before using translation mutations, ensure the following:
- You are using proper and valid language codes for all translations.
- The objects you want to translate (products, variants, attributes, attribute 
values, or promotion rules) already exist in the system.

## Best Practices

### Performance Optimization
- Limit batch sizes to 100 objects per request
- Run operations during off-peak hours
- Monitor system resources during large imports

### Error Handling
- Refer to the [Error policy](error-policy) documentation to select the most appropriate error-handling strategy for your use case.
- Log all errors for troubleshooting

### Data Validation
- Validate data structure before sending
- Check required fields and relationships
- Ensure data consistency across related objects

### Monitoring
- Track progress of bulk operations
- Monitor API response times
- Set up alerts for failed operations
