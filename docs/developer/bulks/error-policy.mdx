title: Error Policy
---

Error policies were added to Saleor to allow users to choose how bulk mutations should behave if an error occurs. All new bulk mutations support `errorPolicy` argument.

## Options

There are three options, how the mutation can handle errors:

### REJECT_EVERYTHING (default)

This is default error policy. If a single error occurs, in at least one of the objects, the whole mutation fails and no data is saved.

### REJECT_FAILED_ROWS

The mutation saves only those objects, which do not produce any error.

### IGNORE_FAILED

If an error occurs for some object, Saleor will try to save it partially and skip the invalid part, if it is possible.

## Policy exceptions

Some mutations can have specific errors, which can change the error policy behavior. For example [`orderBulkCreate`](./bulk-orders#error-policy).
