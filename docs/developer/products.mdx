## Introduction

This guide describes how to obtain products from the Saleor GraphQL API.

You can either retrieve a single product or a list of products. You may require a list of products in many situations, for example, when you need to simply display the catalog in your storefront, or to provide a third party service with a list of products available in your store.

## Retrieving a list of products

To fetch a product list, you need to run the `products` query. The `products` field is a paginated collection, see [Pagination](pagination.mdx) for more information.


Let's take a look at an example query to fetch a list of products:

<GraphQL
  height={20}
  query={`{
  products(first: 2) {
    edges {
      node {
        id
        name
      }
    }
  }
}`}
/>

In this example, for each product, we want to return the following fields:

- `id`: the unique product ID, most operations will require one.
- `name`: the name of the product.

### Filtering

The `products` query gives the ability to filter the results. Use the optional `filter` argument. Some of the filters that are available here are:

- `search: String`: search by name or part of the description.
- `price: ...`: filter by base price:
  - `price: {lte: Float}`: price lower than or equal to given value.
  - `price: {gte: Float}`: price greater than or equal to given value.
- `minimalPrice: ...`: filter by minimal variant price:
  - `minimalPrice: {lte: Float}`: price lower than or equal to given value.
  - `minimalPrice: {gte: Float}`: price greater than or equal to given value.
- `stockAvailability: ...`: filter by available stock:
  - `stockAvailability: IN_STOCK`: only available products.
  - `stockAvailability: OUT_OF_STOCK`: only out-of-stock products.

Here is an example query that looks for the first 3 products containing the term "juice" in the title or description:

<GraphQL
  height={20}
  query={`{
  products(first: 3, filter: { search: "juice" }) {
    edges {
      node {
        name
      }
    }
  }
}`}
/>

### Sorting

In `products` you can also sort the results using two `sortBy` arguments:

- `field`: the field to use for sorting the results from several predefined choices:
  - `DATE`: sort products by last update.
  - `MINIMAL_PRICE`: sort products by minimal variant price.
  - `NAME`: sort products by name.
  - `PRICE`: sort products by base price.
  - `PUBLICATION_DATE`: sort products by publication date.
  - `PUBLISHED`: sort products by publication status.
  - `TYPE`: sort products by product type.
- `direction`: The direction for sorting items:
  - `ASC`: sort ascending.
  - `DESC`: sort descending.

This example shows how to sort the products list by the minimal variant price, lowest to highest:

<GraphQL
  height={25}
  query={`{
  products(
    first: 2
    sortBy: { field: MINIMAL_PRICE, direction: ASC }
  ) {
    edges {
      node {
        name
        minimalVariantPrice {
          amount
          currency
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
`}
/>

## Retrieving a single product

To get a single product, use the `product` query, which requires only one input field:

- `id`: the unique product ID.

Here is the example query that fetches a single product:

```graphql {2}
query {
  product(id: "UHJvZHVjdDoxMTU=") {
    id
    name
  }
}
```

## Retrieving product variants

To obtain product variants, query the `variants` field on the `Product` type:

<GraphQL
  height={25}
  query={`{
  products(first: 1) {
    edges {
      node {
        id
        name
        variants {
          id
          name
        }
      }
    }
  }
}`}
/>

Like products, here we're asking for two fields from each variant:

- `id`: the unique variant ID.
- `name`: the name of the variant.

## Pricing

Use the `pricing` field of products and variants to obtain pricing information.

Here are the available fields for product pricing:

```graphql
type ProductPricingInfo {
  priceRange: TaxedMoneyRange
  priceRangeUndiscounted: TaxedMoneyRange
  discount: TaxedMoney
  onSale: Boolean
}
```

And similar fields for product variants:

```graphql
type VariantPricingInfo {
  price: TaxedMoney
  priceUndiscounted: TaxedMoney
  discount: TaxedMoney
  onSale: Boolean
}
```

The main difference is that products don't have a price point, instead they offer a price range that includes all of their variant prices.

Here are the money types returned by the above:

```graphql
type TaxedMoneyRange {
  # lowest price
  start: TaxedMoney
  # highest price
  stop: TaxedMoney
}

type TaxedMoney {
  # before tax
  net: Money!
  # after tax
  gross: Money!

  # gross - net
  tax: Money!
  # repeated for convenience
  currency: String!
}

type Money {
  amount: Float!
  currency: String!
}
```

## Images

The `Product` type contains two fields that refer to its images:

- `thumbnail`: the product's main image. An optional `size` parameter specifies the desired size in pixels if given. The following fields are available:
  - `url`: the image's URL.
  - `alt`: the alternative text to include when displaying the image.
- `images`: gives you access to the entire list of associated product images with the following fields available:
  - `url`: the image's URL. An optional `size` parameter specifies the desired size in pixels if given.
  - `alt`: the alternative text to include when displaying the image.

Here's a query that asks for both the thumbnail and all images of the first product, optimized for display at 100Ã—100px:

<GraphQL
  height={30}
  query={`{
  products(first: 1) {
    edges {
      node {
        id
        name
        thumbnail(size: 100) {
          url
          alt
        }
        images {
          url(size: 100)
          alt
        }
      }
    }
  }
}`}
/>

## Examples

Here's a more complex GraphQL query that combines all of the above information:

```graphql
{
  products(first: 2, sortBy: {field: NAME}) {
    edges {
      node {
        id
        name
        pricing {
          priceRange {
            start {
              gross {
                amount
                currency
              }
            }
          }
          discount {
            gross {
              amount
              currency
            }
          }
          priceRangeUndiscounted {
            start {
              gross {
                amount
                currency
              }
            }
          }
        }
        thumbnail {
          url
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```
