Saleor includes built-in support for warehouses to manage inventory across multiple locations. A warehouse represents a physical location from which products are stocked, fulfilled, or collected. Warehouses can also serve as collection points using Saleorâ€™s Click and Collect functionality.

You can configure warehouse behavior per channel using three fulfillment options:

- Local stock:

    Only the stock from the current warehouse is used during fulfillment.

- Available only for public warehouses.

    All warehouses:

    Fulfillment can use stock from any warehouse available in the same channel.

    Useful for centralized or dynamic fulfillment strategies.

- Disabled:

    The warehouse is not used as a collection point.

## Warehouse configuration

### Warehouse creation

Firstly we need to create the warehouse with the use of
[`createWarehouse`](api-reference/products/mutations/create-warehouse.mdx) mutation.
In the following example, we are specifying `name`, `slug`, `email` and `address` of a warehouse.

```graphql
mutation {
  createWarehouse(input: {
    name: "Example warehouse",
    slug: "example-warehouse",
    email: "example-warehouse@example.com",
    address: {
      streetAddress1: "Teczowa 8",
      city: "Wroclaw",
      country: PL,
      postalCode: "53-601",
      companyName: "Amazing Company Inc",
    }
  }){
    warehouse {
      id
      name
      slug
      email
      address {
        id
        companyName
      }
    }
    errors {
      message
      field
      code
    }
  }
```

As a response we get the newly created warehouse:

```json
{
  "data": {
    "createWarehouse": {
      "warehouse": {
        "id": "V2FyZWhvdXNlOmJjMjZiNjMzLTg0ZmItNDUxZC1hNTRjLTU1NDc1YjU5NTAzYQ==",
        "name": "Example warehouse",
        "slug": "example-warehouse",
        "email": "example-warehouse@example.com",
        "address": {
          "id": "QWRkcmVzczo2NA==",
          "companyName": "Amazing Company Inc"
        }
      },
      "errors": []
    }
  }
}
```

After the warehouse is created it can be changed with the use of
the [`updateWarehouse`](api-reference/products/mutations/update-warehouse.mdx) mutation.
There is an option to change the following warehouse fields: `name`, `slug`, `email`, `address` and
also define privacy and `click and collect` options.

We can define warehouse as public or private. Public warehouse allows you to query the stock information publicly in the API. Private warehouse requires permission.

### Click-and-collect warehouses

You can define warehouse as a collection point with the `click and collect` option.
There are three options you can use:

- `local stock` - the stock from the current warehouse is used during the fulfillment process.
  This option is only available for public warehouses.
- `all warehouses` - the total stock of a given product from all warehouses is used
  during the fulfillment process. The available quantity is not restricted by the quantity
  of this warehouse, and ordered products can be shipped from any other warehouse that
  is available in the channel.
- `disabled` - the current warehouse cannot be used as the collection point.

In the case of click-and-collect, the warehouse availability does not depend on the shipping zones.
It is limited only by the given channel.
The warehouse is available as a collection point for the given order under two conditions:

- there is a stock with available quantity for a given product,
- the warehouse is available in the channel in which the order is created.

### Assign warehouses to the channels

To allow assigning the warehouse to the shipping zone we need to have at least one common
channel with this zone. So firstly, we need to assign warehouses to channels with the use of
[`channelUpdate`](api-reference/channels/mutations/channel-update.mdx) mutation.
See the example below:

```graphql
  mutation {
    channelUpdate(
      id: "Q2hhbm5lbDoxMQ==",
      input: {
        "addWarehouses": ["V2FyZWhvdXNlOjA4N2I2MzhlLWIxYzYtNDk5Mi1hMWQ1LTZiOWI5N2FjODU1Zg=="]
      }
    ){
      channel{
        id
        warehouses {
          slug
        }
      }
      errors{
        field
        code
        message
        shippingZones
        warehouses
      }
    }
  }
```

As a response, we get the updated channel:

```json
{
  "data": {
    "channelUpdate": {
      "channel": {
        "id": "Q2hhbm5lbDoxMQ==",
        "warehouses": [
          {
            "slug": "example-warehouse"
          }
        ]
      },
      "channelErrors": []
    }
  }
}
```
