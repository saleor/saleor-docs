## Warehouse
Warehouse represents a location where products are stocked for fulfillment or customer collection. 
To effectively manage your inventory, Saleor allows the creation of multiple warehouses. 
Utilizing Saleor's Click and Collect feature, these warehouses can also serve as convenient pickup points. 
For system consistency, even digital products necessitate warehouse configuration within Saleor.

### Relation Between Warehouses and Key Saleor Concepts:
- **Product Variants:** Each product variant can have stock associated with one or more warehouses. 
This allows you to track how many units of each variant are available at each location.
- **Channels:** The availability of stock in a particular warehouse can influence whether 
a product variant is available for sale in a specific channel. 
Crucially, a warehouse must be assigned to a channel. One warehouse can be assigned to multiple channels.
- **Shipping Zones:** Shipping Zones define the geographical areas for which specific 
shipping methods and rates apply. When configuring a shipping zone, you select the warehouse 
from which products will be shipped.
- **Checkout**, **Order** & **Taxes:** Importantly, the **address of a warehouse** can be used 
for shipping address and tax calculation in specific scenarios. 
When a customer chooses a "click and collect" delivery method, Saleor use the warehouse's address to 
determine the applicable taxes. Read more about [calculating taxes for click and collect](/developer/taxes.mdx#example-for-click-and-collect-shipping).

### Warehouse Creation
:::info
Creating warehouse require `MANAGE_PRODUCTS` permission. 

Additionally, accessing certain fields such as Shipping Zones when querying warehouse details requires the `MANAGE_SHIPPING` permission.
:::

You can create warehouses either via the Saleor Dashboard or using the GraphQL API.

#### Saleor Dashboard
1. Navigate to Configuration → Warehouses.
2. Click Create new warehouse.
3. Fill in the warehouse name and address.

#### API

To create a warehouse programmatically, use the [`createWarehouse`](api-reference/products/mutations/create-warehouse.mdx) 
mutation. This method allows for additional fields such as `externalReference` and `email`.

```graphql {2-9}
mutation {
  createWarehouse(
    input: {
      name: "Example warehouse", 
      slug: "example-warehouse", 
      email: "example-warehouse@example.com", 
      externalReference: "Warehouse_001", 
      address: {streetAddress1: "Teczowa 8", city: "Wroclaw", country: PL, postalCode: "53-601", companyName: "Amazing Company Inc"}
    }
  ) {
    warehouse {
      id
      name
      slug
      email
      externalReference
      address {
        id
        companyName
      }
    }
    errors {
      message
      field
      code
    }
  }
}
```

As a response we get the newly created warehouse:

```json
{
  "data": {
    "createWarehouse": {
      "warehouse": {
        "id": "V2FyZWhvdXNlOmY1MTJiMzFjLTUyMzAtNDMwOS05MDdkLTY4NzAyY2NhMjg0MA==",
        "name": "Example warehouse",
        "slug": "example-warehouse",
        "email": "example-warehouse@example.com",
        "externalReference": "Warehouse_001",
        "address": {
          "id": "QWRkcmVzczozNjcx",
          "companyName": "Amazing Company Inc"
        }
      },
      "errors": []
    }
  }
}
```

### Warehouse Update
Once created, following warehouse fields can be updated: `name`, `slug`, `email`, 
`address`, `externalReference`, `isPrivate`, and `clickAndCollectOption`.

:::info
Only public warehouses can later be configured as a collection point.
:::
You can update warehouse using Saleor Dashboard or GraphQL API [`updateWarehouse`](api-reference/products/mutations/update-warehouse.mdx) mutation.

To manage warehouse metadata, use [`updateMetadata`](/api-reference/miscellaneous/mutations/update-metadata.mdx) 
or [`updatePrivateMetadata`](/api-reference/miscellaneous/mutations/update-private-metadata.mdx). 

### Assign Warehouses to the Channels and Shipping

To make a warehouse available for sales and shipping, it must be assigned 
to the appropriate **sales channels** and **shipping zones**.

#### Assign Warehouses to the Channel
The first step is to assign your warehouses to the relevant sales channels using Dashboard or GraphQL API

##### Saleor Dashboard
1. Go to Configuration → Channels.
2. Select the channel you want to configure.
3. On the right panel, find the Warehouses section.
4. Click Add Warehouse.
5. Select a warehouse from the dropdown or search by name.
6. Click Save Channel.

##### API

Use the [`channelUpdate`](api-reference/channels/mutations/channel-update.mdx) mutation to add a warehouse to a channel:

```graphql {2-4}
mutation {
  channelUpdate(
    id: "Q2hhbm5lbDoxMQ=="
    input: {addWarehouses: ["V2FyZWhvdXNlOjA4N2I2MzhlLWIxYzYtNDk5Mi1hMWQ1LTZiOWI5N2FjODU1Zg=="]}
  ) {
    channel {
      id
      warehouses {
        slug
      }
    }
    errors {
      field
      code
      message
      shippingZones
      warehouses
    }
  }
}
```

#### Assign Warehouses to the Shipping Zone
Once a warehouse is linked to at least one channel, it becomes eligible 
to be selected when configuring shipping zones. When setting up a shipping zone, 
you will choose the warehouse(s) from which orders within that zone will be fulfilled. 
This ensures that you are shipping from a location that has inventory available in the relevant sales channels.

To assign warehouse to shipping zone follow 
[these instructions](/developer/shipping/shipping-zone.mdx#assigning-warehouses-to-the-shipping-zone).

### Click-and-collect Warehouses

Warehouses can be configured as customer collection points using the click-and-collect option. 
There are three configuration modes:

- `Local stock` - The warehouse uses its own stock to fulfill click-and-collect orders. 
Only available for public warehouses.
- `All warehouses` - Fulfillment is based on the combined stock of all warehouses in the channel.
The warehouse serves as a collection point, but the products may be shipped from any other 
warehouse available in the channel.
- `Disabled` - The warehouse is not available as a collection point.

In the case of click-and-collect, the warehouse availability does not depend on the shipping zones.
It is limited only by the given channel.

A warehouse is available as a collection point for an order if:
- There is available stock for the product.
- The warehouse is assigned to the channel where the order was placed.


## Stocks
Stocks in Saleor represent the inventory levels of specific product variants 
within designated warehouses. This crucial relationship allows for accurate 
tracking of available quantities, efficient order fulfillment, and proactive stock level monitoring.

### Creating and Updating Stock Levels
Saleor provides GraphQL mutations to manage the stock levels of your product variants programmatically. 
However, stock can also be managed directly through the Saleor Dashboard:
- While editing a product variant, you can assign, update, or remove stock for that variant across different warehouses.
- On the product view, under the variant grid, you can quickly view and adjust stock quantities per variant and warehouse.

#### GraphQL-Based Stock Management
- [`productVariantStocksCreate`](/api-reference/products/mutations/product-variant-stocks-create.mdx):
 This mutation is used to create initial stock levels for a specific product variant in one or more warehouses. 
 It allows you to define the quantity of a variant available at different locations for the first time.

- [`productVariantStocksUpdate`](/api-reference/products/mutations/product-variant-stocks-update.mdx):
This mutation is used to update the existing stock levels of a specific product variant in one or more warehouses. 
You can modify the quantity of a variant at particular locations using variant ID or sku.

- [`productVariantStocksDelete`](/api-reference/products/mutations/product-variant-stocks-delete.mdx):
This mutation is used to remove all stock information for a specific product variant from a particular warehouse. 
This effectively indicates that the variant is no longer stocked at that location.

### Bulk Stock Management

For managing stock levels across multiple product variants and warehouses efficiently, 
Saleor offers bulk operations. Refer to the [Update Stocks in Bulk](/developer/bulks/bulk-stock.mdx) documentation for more details.


### Querying Stocks
Saleor provides stock querying capabilities that help you:
- Monitor inventory levels across warehouses
- Track stock allocations and reservations
- Manage product availability
- Implement inventory alerts and notifications

#### Get All Stocks
You can use the [`stocks`](/api-reference/products/queries/stocks.mdx) query to get all stocks or apply a search filter to get only stocks for variants or a warehouse with a specific name.

```graphql 
query Stocks {
  stocks(first: 10, filter: {search: "Europe"}) {
    totalCount
    edges {
      node {
        id
        quantity
        warehouse {
          id
          name
          slug
        }
        productVariant {
          id
          name
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

#### Get Single Stock
To retrieve detailed information about a specific [`stock`](/api-reference/products/queries/stock.mdx) entry:

```graphql
query Stock {
  stock(id: "U3RvY2s6NjM0") {
    id
    quantity
    warehouse {
      id
      name
    }
    productVariant {
      id
      name
    }
  }
}
```

#### Get Warehouse Stocks
To view all stock entries for a specific [`warehouse`](/api-reference/products/queries/warehouse.mdx), including detailed product information and quantity:

```graphql
query WarehouseStocks {
  warehouse(
    id: "V2FyZWhvdXNlOjI1YzdlZDNlLTljYjQtNDUzNi04ZGNjLTgzZTdlNDIzZTNjMQ=="
  ) {
    stocks(first: 10) {
      totalCount
      edges {
        node {
          id
          warehouse {
            id
            name
          }
          productVariant {
            id
            sku
            name
            product {
              id
              name
            }
          }
          quantity
          quantityAllocated
          quantityReserved
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## Webhooks

Saleor provides several webhooks to help you monitor and react to stock-related events:

- `PRODUCT_VARIANT_OUT_OF_STOCK`: Triggered when a product variant's stock level reaches zero, allowing you to implement low-stock notifications or automatic reordering.
- `PRODUCT_VARIANT_BACK_IN_STOCK`: Triggered when a previously out-of-stock product variant becomes available again, enabling you to notify waiting customers.
- `PRODUCT_VARIANT_STOCK_UPDATED`: Triggered whenever a product variant's stock quantity changes, useful for real-time inventory tracking and synchronization.
- `WAREHOUSE_CREATED`: Triggered when a new warehouse is added to the system, allowing you to update external systems or documentation.
- `WAREHOUSE_UPDATED`: Triggered when warehouse details are modified, helping maintain consistency across integrated systems.
- `WAREHOUSE_DELETED`: Triggered when a warehouse is removed, enabling cleanup of related data in external systems.
- `WAREHOUSE_METADATA_UPDATED`: Triggered when warehouse metadata is changed, useful for tracking warehouse-specific customizations.

For more information on setting up webhooks, refer to the [webhook chapter](/developer/extending/webhooks/overview.mdx).
