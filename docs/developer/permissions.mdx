## User permissions

Instead of assigning permissions directly to the user, we define them on a by-group basis. Organizing access rights into [Groups](developer/api-reference/objects/group.mdx) helps in determining staff users' roles in the organization.

Examples of groups:
- Translators - `MANAGE_TRANSLATIONS` permission.
- Customer support - `MANAGE_ORDERS` and `MANAGE_USERS` permissions.

### Creating and removing groups
To create a new group, use [permissionGroupCreate](developer/api-reference/mutations/permission-group-create.mdx).

Request:
```graphql
mutation {
  permissionGroupCreate(
    input: {
      addPermissions: [MANAGE_GIFT_CARD, MANAGE_DISCOUNTS]
      addUsers: []
      name: "Sale managers"
    }
  ) {
    errors {
      message
    }
    group {
      id
      name
      permissions {
        name
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Successful response:
```json
{
  "data": {
    "permissionGroupCreate": {
      "errors": [],
      "group": {
        "id": "R3JvdXA6NDM=",
        "name": "Sale managers",
        "permissions": [
          {
            "name": "Manage sales and vouchers.",
          },
          {
            "name": "Manage gift cards.",
          }
        ]
      },
    }
  }
}
```

To remove group, use [permissionGroupDelete](developer/api-reference/mutations/permission-group-delete.mdx) mutation.

### Modifying group and managing its members

[permissionGroupUpdate](developer/api-reference/mutations/permission-group-update.mdx) takes a list of user IDs you would like to add or remove from the group. Having a same user in both of the lists will result in an error.

Example request:
```graphql
mutation {
  permissionGroupUpdate(
    id: "R3JvdXA6NDM="
    input: {
      name: "Sale managers"
      addPermissions: []
      removePermissions: []
      addUsers: ["VXNlcjozMg=="]
      removeUsers: []
    }
  ) {
    errors {
      message
    }
  }
}
```

## App permissions

In contrast to users, app permissions are defined per-app basis. Access can be assigned during app installation and modified later using [appUpdate](developer/api-reference/mutations/app-update.mdx) mutation.


## JWT token and permissions

JWT tokens have a list of assigned permissions. By decoding payload using HS256 algorithm you will get:

```json
{
  "iat": 1624013260,
  "iss": "example.com",
  "token": "AixxXXXxzF",
  "email": "john@example.com",
  "type": "access",
  "user_id": "VXNlcjozMg==",
  "is_staff": true,
  "exp": 1624049260,
  "oauth_access_key": "",
  "permissions": [
    "MANAGE_TRANSLATIONS",
    "MANAGE_PRODUCTS",
    "MANAGE_PRODUCT_TYPES_AND_ATTRIBUTES"
  ]
}
```

To check token online and learn more about JWT visit [https://jwt.io](https://jwt.io).

:::note
Since Saleor reads permissions from the JWT, generating new token is nessesary when user permissions change.

## Available permissions

Available permissions are kept in the [PermissionEnum](developer/api-reference/enums/permission-enum.mdx).
