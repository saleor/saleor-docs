## User permissions

The user permissions are divided into data and channel permissions.
Data permissions allow access to certain data types, such as `orders` and `products`.
Channel permissions allow access to that data with restrictions to specific channels.

For example, a user with `MANAGE_ORDERS` and `channel_USD` permissions can only access
orders from the `channel_USD` channel.

The channel restriction affects the access to data restricted by the following permissions:

- `MANAGE_ORDERS`

Instead of assigning permissions directly to the user, we define them on a group basis.
Organizing access rights in [Groups](docs/api-reference/users/objects/group.mdx) helps in determining the roles of team members.

Examples of groups:

- Translators - `MANAGE_TRANSLATIONS` permission.
- Customer support - `MANAGE_ORDERS` and `MANAGE_USERS` permissions.
- Customer support for USD channel - `MANAGE_ORDERS` and `MANAGE_USERS` permissions, `channel_USD` channel.

:::important
When a user is a member of multiple groups, their permissions are summed up.
This means that if the user is in at least one group that has not restricted channel access,
they will have access to data from all channels.

### Creating and removing groups

To create a new group, use the [permissionGroupCreate](docs/api-reference/users/mutations/permission-group-create.mdx) mutation.

#### Creating the group without channel restriction

Request:

```graphql
mutation {
  permissionGroupCreate(
    input: {
      addPermissions: [MANAGE_GIFT_CARD, MANAGE_DISCOUNTS]
      addUsers: []
      name: "Sale managers"
      restrictedAccessToChannels: false
      addChannels: []
    }
  ) {
    errors {
      message
    }
    group {
      id
      name
      permissions {
        name
      }
      restrictedAccessToChannels
      accessibleChannels {
        slug
      }
    }
  }
}
```

A successful response:

```json
{
  "data": {
    "permissionGroupCreate": {
      "errors": [],
      "group": {
        "id": "R3JvdXA6NDM=",
        "name": "Sale managers",
        "permissions": [
          {
            "name": "Manage sales and vouchers."
          },
          {
            "name": "Manage gift cards."
          }
        ]
        "restrictedAccessToChannels": false,
        "accessibleChannels": [
          {
            "slug": "channel-pln"
          },
          {
            "slug": "default-channel"
          }
        ]
      }
    }
  }
}
```

#### Creating a group with channel restrictions

Request:

```graphql
mutation {
  permissionGroupCreate(
    input: {
      addPermissions: [MANAGE_ORDERS]
      addUsers: []
      name: "Order managers for channel USD"
      restrictedAccessToChannels: true
      addChannels: ["Q2hhbm5lbDoy"]
    }
  ) {
    errors {
      message
    }
    group {
      id
      name
      permissions {
        name
      }
      restrictedAccessToChannels
      accessibleChannels {
        slug
      }
    }
  }
}
```

A successful response:

```json
{
  "data": {
    "permissionGroupCreate": {
      "errors": [],
      "group": {
        "id": "R3JvdXA6MjY=",
        "name": "Order managers for USD channel",
        "permissions": [
          {
            "name": "Manage orders."
          }
        ],
        "restrictedAccessToChannels": true,
        "accessibleChannels": [
          {
            "slug": "channel-pln"
          }
        ]
      }
    }
  }
}
```

As we can see, the `accessibleChannels` field differs from the previous example. The users from this
group will have access only to data from the `channel-pln` channel.

:::important
When the `restrictedAccessToChannels` flag is set to `false`, the channels provided
in `addChannels` field will be ignored.
:::

#### Removing a group

To remove a group, use the [permissionGroupDelete](docs/api-reference/users/mutations/permission-group-delete.mdx) mutation:

```graphql
mutation {
  permissionGroupDelete(
    id: "R3JvdXA6NDM="
  ) {
    errors {
      message
    }
}
```

### Modifying a group

#### Managing the group members

The [permissionGroupUpdate](docs/api-reference/users/mutations/permission-group-update.mdx) mutation takes a list of user IDs you would like to add or remove from the group. Having the same user in both lists will result in an error.

Example request:

```graphql
mutation {
  permissionGroupUpdate(
    id: "R3JvdXA6NDM="
    input: {
      name: "Sale managers"
      addPermissions: []
      removePermissions: []
      addUsers: ["VXNlcjozMg=="]
      removeUsers: []
    }
  ) {
    errors {
      message
    }
  }
}
```

#### Managing the group channels

The [permissionGroupUpdate](docs/api-reference/users/mutations/permission-group-update.mdx)
mutation takes a list of channel IDs you would like to add or remove from the group.
Having the same channels in both lists will result in an error.

Example request:

```graphql
mutation {
  permissionGroupUpdate(
    id: "R3JvdXA6MjY="
    input: {
      addPermissions: []
      removePermissions: []
      addChannels: ["Q2hhbm5lbDox"]
      removeChannels: ["Q2hhbm5lbDoy"]
    }
  ) {
    errors {
      message
    }
  }
}
```

:::important
When the `restrictedAccessToChannels` flag is changed from `true` to `false`, all currently assigned channels will be cleared.

When the `restrictedAccessToChannels` flag is set to `false`, the channels provided
in `addChannels` and `removeChannels` fields will be ignored.
:::

## App permissions

App permissions are defined on a per-app basis. Access can be assigned during the app installation and modified later using the [appUpdate](docs/api-reference/apps/mutations/app-update.mdx) mutation.
The apps don't have channel restrictions, so all channels data can be visible by the app with the proper permission.

## JWT token and permissions

JWT tokens have a list of assigned permissions. By decoding payload using RS256 algorithm you will get:

```json
{
  "iat": 1624013260,
  "iss": "example.com",
  "token": "AixxXXXxzF",
  "email": "john@example.com",
  "type": "access",
  "user_id": "VXNlcjozMg==",
  "is_staff": true,
  "exp": 1624049260,
  "oauth_access_key": "",
  "permissions": [
    "MANAGE_TRANSLATIONS",
    "MANAGE_PRODUCTS",
    "MANAGE_PRODUCT_TYPES_AND_ATTRIBUTES"
  ]
}
```

To check the token online and learn more about JWT visit [https://jwt.io](https://jwt.io).

:::note
Since Saleor reads permissions from the JWT token, generating a new token is necessary when the user changes permissions.

## Available permissions

Available permissions are kept in the [PermissionEnum](docs/api-reference/users/enums/permission-enum.mdx).
