## User permissions

The user permissions are divided into data and channel permissions.
Data permissions allow access to certain data types, such as `orders` and `products`.
Channel permissions allow access to that data with restrictions to specific channels.

For example, a user with `MANAGE_ORDERS` and `channel_USD` permissions can only access
orders from the `channel_USD` channel.

The channel restriction affects the access to data restricted by the following permissions:

- `MANAGE_ORDERS`

Instead of assigning permissions directly to the user, we define them on a group basis.
Organizing access rights in [`Groups`](/api-reference/users/objects/group.mdx) helps in determining the roles of team members.

Examples of groups:

- Translators - `MANAGE_TRANSLATIONS` permission.
- Customer support - `MANAGE_ORDERS` and `MANAGE_USERS` permissions.
- Customer support for USD channel - `MANAGE_ORDERS` and `MANAGE_USERS` permissions, `channel_USD` channel.

:::important
When a user is a member of multiple groups, their permissions are summed up.
This means that if the user is in at least one group that has not restricted channel access,
they will have access to data from all channels.
:::

### Creating and removing groups

You can create permission group either via the Saleor Dashboard or using the GraphQL API.

#### Saleor Dashboard
1. Navigate to Configuration → Permission Groups.
2. Click Create Permission group
3. Name the group, select permissions and channels. 
Once saved you can assign group members from existing staff users.  

#### API

To create a group programmatically, use the [`permissionGroupCreate`](/api-reference/users/mutations/permission-group-create.mdx) 
mutation. This method allows for assigning users during group creation.

#### Creating the group without channel restriction

<Tabs>
<TabItem value="Mutation">
```graphql
mutation PermissionGroupCreate($input: PermissionGroupCreateInput!) {
  permissionGroupCreate(input: $input) {
    errors {
      message
    }
    group {
      id
      name
      permissions {
        name
      }
      restrictedAccessToChannels
      accessibleChannels {
        slug
      }
    }
  }
}
```
</TabItem>

<TabItem value={"Variables"}>
```json
{
  "input": {
      "addPermissions": ["MANAGE_GIFT_CARD", "MANAGE_DISCOUNTS"],
      "addUsers": [],
      "name": "Sale managers",
      "restrictedAccessToChannels": false,
      "addChannels": []
    }
}
```
</TabItem>

<TabItem value={"Result"}>
```json
{
  "data": {
    "permissionGroupCreate": {
      "errors": [],
      "group": {
        "id": "R3JvdXA6NDM=",
        "name": "Sale managers",
        "permissions": [
          {
            "name": "Manage sales and vouchers."
          },
          {
            "name": "Manage gift cards."
          }
        ]
        "restrictedAccessToChannels": false,
        "accessibleChannels": [
          {
            "slug": "channel-pln"
          },
          {
            "slug": "default-channel"
          }
        ]
      }
    }
  }
}
```
</TabItem>
</Tabs>

#### Creating a group with channel restrictions

<Tabs>
<TabItem value="Mutation">
```graphql
mutation PermissionGroupCreate($input: PermissionGroupCreateInput!) {
  permissionGroupCreate(input: $input) {
    errors {
      message
    }
    group {
      id
      name
      permissions {
        name
      }
      restrictedAccessToChannels
      accessibleChannels {
        slug
      }
    }
  }
}
```
</TabItem>

<TabItem value={"Variables"}>
```json
{
  "input": {
    "addPermissions": [
      "MANAGE_ORDERS"
    ],
    "addUsers": [],
    "name": "Order managers for channel USD",
    "restrictedAccessToChannels": true,
    "addChannels": [
      "Q2hhbm5lbDoy"
    ]
  }
}
```
</TabItem>

<TabItem value={"Result"}>

```json
{
  "data": {
    "permissionGroupCreate": {
      "errors": [],
      "group": {
        "id": "R3JvdXA6MjY=",
        "name": "Order managers for USD channel",
        "permissions": [
          {
            "name": "Manage orders."
          }
        ],
        "restrictedAccessToChannels": true,
        "accessibleChannels": [
          {
            "slug": "channel-pln"
          }
        ]
      }
    }
  }
}
```
</TabItem>
</Tabs>

As we can see, the `accessibleChannels` field differs from the previous example. The users from this
group will have access only to data from the `channel-pln` channel.

:::important
When the `restrictedAccessToChannels` flag is set to `false`, the channels provided
in `addChannels` field will be ignored.
:::

### Removing a group

To remove a group, use the [`permissionGroupDelete`](/api-reference/users/mutations/permission-group-delete.mdx) mutation:

<Tabs>
<TabItem value="Mutation">
```graphql
mutation PermissionGroupDelete($id: ID!) {
  permissionGroupDelete(id: $id) {
    errors {
      code
      message
    }
  }
}
```
</TabItem>

<TabItem value={"Variables"}>
```json
{
  "id": "R3JvdXA6NDM=",
}
```
</TabItem>
</Tabs>

### Modifying a group

#### Managing the group members

The [`permissionGroupUpdate`](/api-reference/users/mutations/permission-group-update.mdx) mutation takes a list of user IDs you would like to add or remove from the group. Having the same user in both lists will result in an error.

Example request:
<Tabs>
<TabItem value="Mutation">
```graphql
mutation PermissionGroupUpdate($id: ID!, $input: PermissionGroupUpdateInput!) {
  permissionGroupUpdate(id: $id, input: $input) {
    errors {
      message
    }
  }
}
```
</TabItem>

<TabItem value={"Variables"}>
```json
{
  "id": "R3JvdXA6NDM=",
  "input": {
    "name": "Sale managers",
    "addPermissions": [],
    "removePermissions": [],
    "addUsers": [
      "VXNlcjozMg=="
    ],
    "removeUsers": []
  }
}
```
</TabItem>
</Tabs>

#### Managing the group channels

The [`permissionGroupUpdate`](/api-reference/users/mutations/permission-group-update.mdx)
mutation takes a list of channel IDs you would like to add or remove from the group.
Having the same channels in both lists will result in an error.

Example request:
<Tabs>
<TabItem value="Mutation">
```graphql
mutation PermissionGroupUpdate($id: ID!, $input: PermissionGroupUpdateInput!) {
  permissionGroupUpdate(id: $id, input: $input) {
    errors {
      message
    }
  }
}
```
</TabItem>

<TabItem value={"Variables"}>
```json
{
  "id": "R3JvdXA6MjY=",
  "input": {
    "addPermissions": [],
    "removePermissions": [],
    "addChannels": [
      "Q2hhbm5lbDox"
    ],
    "removeChannels": [
      "Q2hhbm5lbDoy"
    ]
  }
}
```
</TabItem>
</Tabs>

:::important
When the `restrictedAccessToChannels` flag is changed from `true` to `false`, all currently assigned channels will be cleared.

When the `restrictedAccessToChannels` flag is set to `false`, the channels provided
in `addChannels` and `removeChannels` fields will be ignored.

## App permissions

:::info

App permissions are described in the [App permissions](/developer/extending/apps/architecture/app-permissions.mdx) article.

:::

## JWT token and permissions

JWT tokens have a list of assigned permissions. By decoding payload using RS256 algorithm you will get:

```json
{
  "iat": 1624013260,
  "iss": "example.com",
  "token": "AixxXXXxzF",
  "email": "john@example.com",
  "type": "access",
  "user_id": "VXNlcjozMg==",
  "is_staff": true,
  "exp": 1624049260,
  "oauth_access_key": "",
  "permissions": [
    "MANAGE_TRANSLATIONS",
    "MANAGE_PRODUCTS",
    "MANAGE_PRODUCT_TYPES_AND_ATTRIBUTES"
  ]
}
```

To check the token online and learn more about JWT visit [https://jwt.io](https://jwt.io).

:::note
Since Saleor reads permissions from the JWT token, generating a new token is necessary when the user changes permissions.
:::

## `Query.me` vs `Query.user`

When working with permissions in Saleor, it's important to understand:

- **`Query.me`** returns the *effective permissions* of the currently authenticated user, 
as encoded in the access token. This includes permissions granted dynamically, such as through Single Sign-On (SSO) 
or Role-Based Access Control (RBAC). These may not be stored on the User object in the database.
- **`Query.user`** returns only the permissions stored for a specific user in the database. 
It does *not* include any permissions granted dynamically.

## Available permissions

Available permissions are kept in the [PermissionEnum](/api-reference/users/enums/permission-enum.mdx).
