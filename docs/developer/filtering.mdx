:::info

The `where` filtering approach was introduced in **Saleor 3.11**. For now, it's only
available on the `Attribute` type.

This feature is in the **Feature Preview** stage, which means that it is available for experimentation and
feedback. However, it is still undergoing development and is subject to modifications.

## Introduction

The `where` filtering allows specifying more complex conditions with the use of `AND` and `OR` operators,
combined with operations like equal (`eq`), one of, and range. It's available under the `where` option,
for now, only on the [attributes](docs/api-reference/attributes/queries/attributes.mdx) query.

### General approach

- Currently only `AND` and `OR` operators are available.
  (See the example for [AND](#filtering-with-the-and-operator) and [OR](#filtering-with-the-or-operator) operator usage).
- You can filter by flat fields and specify operators, but you cannot mix these two approaches.
  ([See the example](#mixing-flat-field-filter-and-operator-and-or)).
- At each level, you can specify only one operator. ([See the example](#mixing-operators-on-the-same-level)).
- In the new `where` approach, each field of a given type has a corresponding filter option.
  As a result, the `search` filter is now located at the top level. ([See the example](##search-filtering)).
- The filter input type corresponds to the property name in the API type.
- The string, enum, date, and all numeric type fields have specific input types
  with available operations options. Currently, there is an option to filter by specific
  value ([example](#filtering-by-a-specific-value)) and list of values ([example](#filtering-by-a-list-of-values)).
- You can only specify one operation. Using `eq` or `oneOf` is acceptable, but using both will result in an error. ([See the example](#mixing-different-operations)).
- You cannot provide both `filter` and `where` options at the same time. ([See the example](#mixing-filter-and-where-options)).

## Examples

To use new filters you need to specify the `where` option.
The following examples will be presented on the `attributes` query.

### Filtering by a specific value

To filter by a specific value, use the `eq` operation. Only object with the exact match
will be returned.

> **_Example:_** _Return attributes that have `Flavor` name._

```graphql {2}
query {
  attributes(first: 20, where: { type: { oneOf: ["Flavor"] } }) {
    edges {
      node {
        id
        name
        inputType
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### Filtering by a list of values

To filter by a list of values use the `oneOf` operator. All objects that have a matching value
specified in the list are returned.

> **_Example_**: _Return attributes that input type is `DATE`, or `DATE_TIME`._

```graphql {2}
query {
  attributes(first: 20, where: { inputType: { oneOf: [DATE, DATE_TIME] } }) {
    edges {
      node {
        id
        name
        inputType
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### Filtering with the `AND` operator

The `AND` operator allows for defining a list of conditions that must be met.

> **_Example:_** _Return attributes that have `Author` name, and slug "tom" or "james"._

```graphql {5}
query {
  attributes(
    first: 20
    where: {
      AND: [{ name: { eq: "Author" } }, { slug: { oneOf: ["tom", "james"] } }]
    }
  ) {
    edges {
      node {
        id
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### Filtering with the `OR` operator

The `OR` operator allows you to define a list of conditions, of which at least one must be fulfilled.

> **_Example:_** _Return attributes that have `Author` name, or input type `DATE` or `DATE_TIME`._

```graphql {5-8}
query {
  attributes(
    first: 20
    where: {
      OR: [
        { name: { eq: "Author" } }
        { inputType: { oneOf: [DATE, DATE_TIME] } }
      ]
    }
  ) {
    edges {
      node {
        id
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### Nested conditions

The operators can be nested, but it's not allowed to combine operators at the same level.

> **_Example:_** _Return attributes that are `PRODUCT_TYPE` type, and the `id` is `QXR0cmlidXRlOjIx` or `QXR0cmlidXRlOjI3`, or the attribute `name` is `Size`._

```graphql {5-13}
query {
  attributes(
    first: 20
    where: {
      AND: [
        { type: { eq: PRODUCT_TYPE } }
        {
          OR: [
            { ids: ["QXR0cmlidXRlOjIx", "QXR0cmlidXRlOjI3"] }
            { name: { eq: "Size" } }
          ]
        }
      ]
    }
  ) {
    edges {
      node {
        id
        name
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### Search filtering

To use the full-text search capabilities, use the root-level `search` argument.

> **_Example:_** _Search attributes by `size` value_

```graphql {2}
query {
  attributes(first: 20, search: "size") {
    edges {
      node {
        id
        name
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## Invalid examples

### Mixing flat field filter and operator `AND`, `OR`

> **_Example:_** _Return attributes that name is `Author` and type is `PRODUCT-TYPE`._

```graphql {4-5}
query {
   attributes(
    where: {
        type: {eq: PRODUCT-TYPE}},
        AND: [{name: {eq: "Author"}}]
    }) {
      edges {
          node {
             id
          }
      }
   }
}
```

**INSTEAD:** Join both conditions into one `AND` filter input

```graphql {3}
query {
  attributes(
    where: { AND: [{ name: { eq: "Author" } }, { type: { eq: PRODUCT_TYPE } }] }
  ) {
    edges {
      node {
        id
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### Mixing operators on the same level

> **_Example:_** _Return attributes that have `DROPDOWN` input type,
> and the `slug` is `blue` or `green`, or the attribute `name` is `Size`._

```graphql {5-6}
query {
  attributes(
    first: 20
    where: {
      AND: [{ inputType: { eq: DROPDOWN } }]
      OR: [{ slug: { oneOf: ["blue", "green"] } }, { name: { eq: "Size" } }]
    }
  ) {
    edges {
      node {
        id
        name
      }
    }
  }
}
```

**INSTEAD:** Nest `OR` condition inside `AND`

```graphql {5-10}
query {
  attributes(
    first: 20
    where: {
      AND: [
        { inputType: { eq: DROPDOWN } }
        {
          OR: [{ slug: { oneOf: ["blue", "green"] } }, { name: { eq: "Size" } }]
        }
      ]
    }
  ) {
    edges {
      node {
        id
        name
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### Mixing `filter` and `where` options

```graphql {4-5}
query {
   attributes(
    first: 20
    filter: {type: PRODUCT-TYPE}
    where: {AND: [{name: {eq: "Author"}}]}
){
      edges {
          node {
             id
          }
      }
   }
}
```

**INSTEAD:** Use `filter` or `where`

### Mixing different operations

```graphql {3}
query {
  attributes(
    where: { AND: [{ name: { eq: "Author", oneOf: ["Author", "Juice"] } }] }
  ) {
    edges {
      node {
        id
      }
    }
  }
}
```

**INSTEAD:** Use the `eq` or `oneOf` operation.
