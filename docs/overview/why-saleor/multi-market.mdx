## Channels

Saleor provides flexible multichannel support, where each channel can represent a region ("Europe"), an autonomous business division ("My Brand EMEA"), a separate brand ("My Niche Brand"), a sales channel ("My Mobile App"), etc.

Order data can be isolated to limit unnecessary exposure of PII. Shipping and payments can be configured independently for each channel to match customer expectations or to use different merchant accounts.

Meanwhile, the product catalog, warehouse network, and stock information remain shared, eliminating the need for synchronization of multiple backend instances.

## Localization

Each channel can use a different currency to transact. Saleor supports all the ISO 4217 currency codes and knows that the Japanese *yen* does not have a subunit (and thus no decimal places) and that the Iraqi *dinar* splits into a thousand fils (and thus needs to be rounded to three decimal places).

Saleor allows most information to be translated. Translations are independent from channels, and all commonly used locales, as described by RFC 5646, are supported. This means you can choose to provide both a generic German translation and one that specifically targets speakers of Austrian German.

Saleor also knows how to validate addresses for different places around the world and will help you figure out which fields are required, which fields to include, how to label them, and in what order to show them. It will also validate phone numbers and postal codes where applicable.
