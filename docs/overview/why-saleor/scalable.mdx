title: Scalable
---

Running Saleor on our own infrastructure means
we are incentive to optimize our costs to stay competitive with other hosting providers.
We are constantly fine-tuning and optimizing our codebase performance.

- Saleor Core is cloud native.

- API only approach means platform extensions cannot degrade the reliability of the platform.

- Saleor is used by global brands that run tens of thousands of requests per second.

- Running Saleor on our own infrastructure means
  we are incentive to optimize our costs.

- Designed for horizontal scaling
  (centralized database, stateless workers, workers can be duplicated up to the database server's capacity)

- Designed for database clustering (single writer, replicas used for reading)

- Outgoing communication based on queues (SQS, Google Pub/Sub)

- Designed for big data sets
  (eventual consistency over immediate consistency, a lot of recalculation delegated to background tasks,
  upkeep done through periodic tasks with constant bandwidth, not to put too much pressure on the database)

## Avoiding feature bloat

The boundaries of commerce platform can often spill over into other areas of business.
We have clear focus on what we think are essential features for a commerce platform
which allows us to retain focus on user experience, reliability and performance.

We value **extensibility over completeness of features** because we believe every business has unique needs,
and it is not possible to be everything to everyone.

### Non core features

Functionality we believe should be handled by external tools:

- **Search.**
  Fast and intelligent search requires a dedicated engine and infrastructure.
  There are many open-source and commercial solutions available that can be integrated with Saleor.

- **Personalization and AI.** Problem that is typically unique to each business.

- **Business intelligence.**
  Basic analytics are only useful for small scale operations, and can quickly become obsolete.

- **Email marketing and marketing automation**
  We believe marketing stack is a separate domain from a commerce platform.

- **Frontend and theming**
  Read [Why headless commerce](overview/why-saleor/headless.mdx) for more information.

- **Marketplaces**
  Definition of a marketplace is broad therefore a good candidate for a dedicated solution.
