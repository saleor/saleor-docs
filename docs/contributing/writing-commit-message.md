title: Writing Good Commit Messages
---

To speed up the review process and to keep the logs tidy, we recommend the following simple rules on how to write good commit messages:

## Summary line

* It should contain less than 50 characters. It is best to make it short
* Introduce what has changed, using imperatives: fix, add, modify, etc.

## Description 

* Add extra explanation if you feel it will help others to understand the summary content
* If you want, use bullet points (each bullet beginning with a hyphen or an asterisk)
* Avoid writing in one line. Use line breaks so the reader does not have to scroll horizontally

> **Tip**
>
> To ease review, try to limit your commits to a single, self-contained issue. This will also help others to understand and manage them in the future.
