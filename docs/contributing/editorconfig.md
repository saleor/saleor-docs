The [EditorConfig](http://editorconfig.org/) is a standard configuration file that aims to ensure consistent style across multiple programming environments.

Saleorâ€™s repository contains an [.editorconfig file](https://github.com/mirumee/saleor/blob/master/.editorconfig) describing our formatting requirements.

Most editors and IDEs support this file either directly or via plugins. See the [list of supported editors and IDEs](http://editorconfig.org/#download) for detailed instructions.

If you make sure that your programming environment respects the contents of this file, you will automatically get correct indentation, encoding, and line endings.
