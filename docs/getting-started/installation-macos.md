title: Installation for macOS
---


## Prerequisites

Before you are ready to run Saleor you will need additional software installed on your computer.


### Node.js

Version 10 or later is required. Download the macOS installer from the [Node.js downloads page](https://nodejs.org/en/download/).


### PostgreSQL

Saleor needs PostgreSQL version 9.4 or above to work. Get the macOS installer from the [PostgreSQL download page](https://www.postgresql.org/download/macosx/).


### Command Line Tools for Xcode

Download and install the latest version of “Command Line Tools (macOS 10.x) for Xcode 9.x” from the [Downloads for Apple Developers page](https://developer.apple.com/download/more/).

Then run:

```console
$ xcode-select --install
```
### Homebrew

Run the following command:

```console
$ /usr/bin/ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)"
```
### Python 3

Use Homebrew to install the latest version of Python 3:

```console
$ brew install python3
```


### Git

Use Homebrew to install Git:

```console
$ brew install git
```


### Gtk+

Use Homebrew to install the graphical libraries necessary for PDF creation:

```console
$ brew install cairo pango gdk-pixbuf libffi
```


## Installation

Once you have installed or updated the prerequisite software, you are ready for your Saleor installation. Follow the steps below to start and execute the process:

### 1. Clone the repository (or use your own fork)

```console
$ git clone https://github.com/mirumee/saleor.git
```


### 2. Enter the directory

```console
$ cd saleor/
```

### 3. Install all dependencies

```console
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
```
> **Tip**
>
> We strongly recommend creating a virtual environment before installing any Python packages.


### 4. Set `SECRET_KEY` environment variable

We try to provide usable default values for all the settings. We have decided not to provide a default for `SECRET_KEY` as we fear someone would inevitably ship a project with the default value left in the code.

```console
$ export SECRET_KEY='<mysecretkey>'
```

> **Warning**
>
> Secret key should be a unique string that only your team knows. Running the code with a known `SECRET_KEY` defeats many of Django’s security protections, and can lead to privilege escalation and remote code execution vulnerabilities. Consult [Django’s documentation](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.11/ref/settings/#secret-key) for details.


### 5. Create a PostgreSQL user

Unless configured otherwise, the store will use `saleor` as both username and password. Remember to assign your user the `SUPERUSER` privilege. This will allow you to create databases and database extensions.

```console
$ createuser --superuser --pwprompt saleor
```

Enter `saleor` when prompted for password.


### 6. Create a PostgreSQL database

> **Note**
>
> Database name is extracted from the `DATABASE_URL` environment variable. If absent it defaults to `saleor`.

```console
$ createdb saleor
```

### 7. Prepare the database

```console
$ python manage.py migrate
```

> **Warning**
>
> This command creates database extensions. If instead you get an error related to the `CREATE EXTENSION` command, please return to the instructions in the PostgreSQL user creation step.


### 8. Install front-end dependencies

```console
$ npm install
```

> **Note**
>
> If this step fails, make sure you are using recent version of Node.js.


### 9. Prepare front-end assets

```console
$ npm run build-assets
```


### 10. Compile e-mails

```console
$ npm run build-emails
```


### 11. Start the development server

```console
$ python manage.py runserver
```
