## Pulling translations from Transifex

Make sure you have the Transifex command-line client installed by `python -m pip install transifex-client` or `python -m pip install -r requirements_dev.txt`. 
For Pipenv users, the comman line can also be installed by `pipenv install --dev`.

Once the installation is processed, use the pull command to pull translations:

```console
$ tx pull
```

> **Note:**
>
> Call `tx pull` with the `--all` flag to create locale directories for newly created translations.


## Compiling message catalogs

This is required for Django to see the translations.

```console
$ python manage.py compilemessages
```

> **Note**
>
> On Windows, you will need to install GNU’s `gettext` command: [gettext-iconv](https://mlocati.github.io/articles/gettext-iconv-windows.html). 
Make sure to check “**Add to PATH**” during the installation.
>
> After the installation, make sure to restart your terminal or software, so the changes are processed properly.


## Extracting messages to translate

When enabled, it will update the English language files with messages that appear in your code.

* For backend code and templates:

```console
$ python manage.py makemessages -l en --extension=email,html,mjml,py,txt --ignore="templates/templated_email/compiled/*"
```

* For JavaScript code:

```console
$ python manage.py makemessages -l en -d djangojs --ignore="_build/*" --ignore="node_modules/*" --ignore="saleor/static/assets/*"
```
