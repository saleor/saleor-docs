Saleor is using schema.org markup to highlight the most important information within an email and allow users to easily interact with it. 

[Order confirmation email](https://developers.google.com/gmail/markup/reference/order) will be displayed as an interactive summary card.

Email Markup is enabled by default, however your customers do not see it until you [Register with Google](https://developers.google.com/gmail/markup/registering-with-google).
