title: Error tracking with Sentry
---

Saleor provides integration with [Sentry](https://sentry.io/) - a comprehensive error tracking and reporting tool.

To enable basic error reporting you have to export an environment variable:

- `SENTRY_DSN` - Sentry Data Source Name.

If you need to customize the service, please go to the [official Sentry’s documentation for Django](https://docs.sentry.io/clients/python/integrations/django/) for more details.
