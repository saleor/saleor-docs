Before filling your shop with products we need to introduce 3 product concepts - _product types_, _products_, _product variants_.


## Overview

Consider a book store. One of your products is a book titled “Introduction to Saleor”.

The book is available in hard and soft cover, so there would be _2 product variants_.

Type of cover is the only attribute which creates separate variants in our store, so we use product type named “Book” with variants enabled and a “Cover type” _variant attribute_.

## Product Variants

Variants are the most important objects in your shop. All cart and stock operations use variants. Even if a product doesn’t have multiple variants, the store will create one under the hood.


## Products

Describes common details of a few product variants. When the shop displays the category view, items on the list are distinct products. If the variant has no overridden property (example: price), the default value is taken from the product.


### `publication_date`

Until this date the product is not listed in storefront and is unavailable for users.


## Product Types

Think about types as templates for your products. Multiple products can use the same product type.


### `product_attributes`

Attributes shared among all product variants. Example: publisher; all book variants are published by same company.


### `variant_attributes`

It’s what distinguishes different variants. Example: cover type; your book can be in hard or soft cover.


### `is_shipping`_required

Indicates whether purchases need to be delivered. Example: digital products or services.


### `has_variants`

Turn this off if your product does not have multiple variants or if you want to create separate products for every one of them.

This option mainly simplifies product management in the dashboard. There is always at least one variant created under the hood.


### `is_digital`

Specify if the given product type is dedicated to digital items. `is_shipping_required` should be turned off along with this flag. Turn it on if you have digital content (ebooks, mp3s, other files) that should be send to the user after fulfillment.

> **Warning**
>
> Changing a product type affects all products of this type.

> **Warning**
>
> You can’t remove a product type if there are products of that type.


## Digital Products

A product can be digital. To do that you need to check two db models responsible for storing and serving digital content. Below you can find a description for `DigitalContent` and `DigitalContentUrl`.


### `DigitalContent`

| Field | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `use_default_settings` | Specify if this content should be served to the customers based on default settings. By default it is True. |
| `automatic_fulfillment` | Indicates whether digital content should be served to the customer directly after payment confirmation. |
| `product_variant` | One to One relation to ProductVariant. |
| `content_file` | File handler. |
| `max_downloads` | Determines how many times a download link can be accessed by a customer. |
| `url_valid_days` | Determines for how many days a download link is active after generation. |


### `DigitalContentUrl`

| Field | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `token` | Contains a unique token needed to generate url. |
| `content` | Foreign key to Digital Content. Specify the digital content that DigitalContentUrl belongs to. |
| `download_num` | Number of times url was used to download content. |
| `line` | Foreign key to OrderLine. Fulfillment assigns a new url to line with digital product. |

`DigitalContentUrl` contains all information about a single url that was send to a customer.

A product that will serve as digital content needs to be assigned to a product type marked as digital. The file can be uploaded by using GraphQL api, mutation - `digitalContentCreate` which takes a variant_id, digital settings and file as an input. Each digital variant can use default or custom settings. To use custom settings you need to modify `DigitalContent` fields: `automatic_fulfillment`, `max_downloads`, `url_valid_days` and mark `use_default_settings` as `false`. You can always come back to default settings by choosing `true` on `use_default_settings`.

During fulfilling a digital line, the new unique url pointing on content will be generated and assigned to the order line. The fulfillment email will contain information with a unique direct link to the download page. The site settings model contains default configuration for digital products. You can set up default values for `automatic_fulfillment`, `max_downloads`, and `url_valid_days`.


## Attributes

_Attributes_ can help you better describe your products. Also, the can be used to filter items in category views.

The attribute values display in the storefront in the order that they are listed in the list in attribute details view. You can reorder them by handling an icon on the left to the values and dragging them to another position.


### Examples

- _Choice type:_ Colors of a t-shirt (for example `‘Red’`, `‘Green’`, `‘Blue’`)
- _Text type:_ Number of pages in a book
