Saleor uses [`VersatileImageField`](https://github.com/respondcreate/django-versatileimagefield) replacement for Django’s ImageField. For performance reasons, in non-debug mode thumbnails are pre-generated by the worker’s task, fired after saving the instance. 
Accessing missing image will result in 404 error.

In debug mode thumbnails are generated on demand.


## Generating products thumbnails manually

Create missing thumbnails for all ProductImage instances:

```console
$ python manage.py create_thumbnails
```


## Deleting images

Image renditions are not deleted automatically with the image instance, nor is the main image. 
To find out more on deleting images see: [`VersatileImageField` documentation](https://django-versatileimagefield.readthedocs.io/en/latest/deleting_created_images.html).
