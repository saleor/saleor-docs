title: Upgrading from 3.13 to 3.14
sidebar_position: 7
---

:::info
To follow the zero-downtime strategy when upgrading to 3.14, **It is recommended to first migrate to at least 3.13.17** and turn on the Celery worker to process all data migrations asynchronously.
Otherwise, you will need to downtime your solution to ensure correct data migration.
:::

This migration guide describes the upgrade from versions 3.13 to 3.14. Version 3.14 contains the following breaking changes:

## Channel permissions

Channel permissions allow limiting staff user access only to certain channels. To ensure
the proper functioning of OAuth permissions, ensure that the `Default permission group name for new staff users`
is set to a permission group with no channel restrictions.

## Plugins manager:

In Saleor 3.14, sales applied to checkout are denormalized. The `CheckoutLineInfo` object now includes a `discounts: List["CheckoutLineDiscount"]`. This field contains the sales that are applied to the lines. As a consequence of this change, the `discounts` field has been removed from the listed plugin manager methods. Instead of the `discounts` argument, an applied discount is now assigned to each line in the `CheckoutLineInfo` inside the `CheckoutInfo` object.
This change applies to the following methods:

- `calculate_checkout_total`
- `calculate_checkout_subtotal`
- `calculate_checkout_shipping`
- `get_checkout_shipping_tax_rate`
- `calculate_checkout_line_total`
- `calculate_checkout_line_unit_price`
- `get_checkout_line_tax_rate`
- `preprocess_order_creation`

:::note
In the future, It is planned to add objects created by vouchers that can be applied to checkout. More information in [RFC](https://github.com/saleor/saleor/issues/12108).
