title: Migrating from USER_NOTIFY to dedicated events
---

Starting from Saleor 3.16, the `NOTIFY_USER` webhook event will be deprecated. Apps that use this webhook should migrate to dedicated webhook events. Below is a list of webhook events that replace particular notifications. All webhook events that replace `NOTIFY_USER` support [subscription queries](developer/extending/webhooks/subscription-webhook-payloads.mdx#custom-payloads), allowing you to define the payload you want to receive for your notifications.

The table below shows sub-types of `USER_NOTIFY` events (represented as the `notify_event` field in the legacy payloads), their GraphQL subscription replacements, and the Saleor version in which they were or will be introduced.

To migrate to new events, you need to create new webhooks in Saleor and provide subscription queries for the events you want to receive.
