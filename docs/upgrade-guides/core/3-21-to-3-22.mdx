:::info
To follow the zero-downtime strategy when upgrading to 3.21, **It is recommended to first migrate to latest 3.20.X** and turn on the Celery worker to process all data migrations asynchronously.
Otherwise, you will need to downtime your solution to ensure correct data migration.

## Changes to orders with a zero total amount

The following changes were implemented to orders with a zero total amount:

- No manual charge (`Transaction` or `Payment`) object will be created.
- The `OrderEvents.ORDER_MARKED_AS_PAID` event will no longer be emitted.

## Automatic checkout completion behavior change for checkouts with total being 0

Before version 3.22, the following scenario would result in automatic checkout completion. In version 3.22 and onwards, this behavior has changed.

Preconditions:
- Channel has an automatic checkout completion feature enabled
- Checkout has a total amount equal to zero
- Checkout has lines

Upon processing a transaction, the checkout would have been completed because then, it was not considered fully paid. Transaction logic recognized the authorization status change, which triggered automatic checkout completion.

Now, upon processing a transaction, the checkout will not get completed because checkout is already considered fully paid; therefore, transaction logic does not recognize any authorization status change thus automatic checkout completion is not triggered.
