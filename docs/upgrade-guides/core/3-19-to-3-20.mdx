:::info
To follow the zero-downtime strategy when upgrading to 3.20, **It is recommended to first migrate to latest 3.19.X** and turn on the Celery worker to process all data migrations asynchronously.
Otherwise, you will need to downtime your solution to ensure correct data migration.

## Private media storage

Since Saleor 3.20 webhook event delivery payloads are stored as files using dedicated private storage.
Make sure `PRIVATE_FILE_STORAGE` is configured properly in `settings.py` before upgrade. 

Please refer to [Amazon S3](/setup/media-s3) or [Google Cloud Storage (GCS)](/setup/media-gcs) guidelines if you are using cloud storage.
