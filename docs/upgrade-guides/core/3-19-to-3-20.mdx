title: Upgrading From 3.19 To 3.20
sidebar_position: 2
---

:::info
To follow the zero-downtime strategy when upgrading to 3.20, **It is recommended to first migrate to latest 3.19.X** and turn on the Celery worker to process all data migrations asynchronously.
Otherwise, you will need to downtime your solution to ensure correct data migration.
:::

## Private media storage

Since Saleor 3.20 webhook event delivery payloads are stored as files using dedicated private storage.
Make sure `PRIVATE_FILE_STORAGE` is configured properly in `settings.py` before upgrade. 

Please refer to [Amazon S3](/setup/media-s3.mdx) or [Google Cloud Storage (GCS)](/setup/media-gcs.mdx) guidelines if you are using cloud storage.

## Automatic checkout completion

Saleor 3.20 added new functionality to automatically complete `Checkout` that have been paid by the customer.

ðŸ‘‰ To learn more, about how this feature works and how to enable it, [read the Automatic Checkout completion docs](/developer/payments/transactions.mdx#automatic-checkout-completion).

:::info
By "paid" in this guide we mean that the `TransactionItems` connected to `Checkout` have fully covered [`Checkout.totalPrice`](/api-reference/checkout/objects/checkout.mdx#checkouttotalpricetaxedmoney---), which results in [`Checkout.authorizeStatus`](/developer/payments/lifecycle.mdx#authorization-status-calculation-for-checkout) being set to [`FULL`](/api-reference/checkout/enums/checkout-authorize-status-enum.mdx).

Learn more about this in [Transaction docs](/developer/payments/transactions.mdx#automatic-checkout-completion)
:::

This feature is **disabled** for existing instances by default and needs to be enabled manually in the [channel settings](/developer/channels/configuration.mdx#settings).

New Saleor instances created from version 3.20 onwards will have this feature **enabled by default**.

This removes the need for storefront implementation to call `checkoutComplete` mutation in order to create `Order`.

Previously a store might have had missing orders, due to `checkoutComplete` mutation not being always called. This could have happened for many unexpected reasons: network issues, storefront bug, customer leaving website, closing tab before being redirected from payment provider, etc.

:::tip
Before Saleor 3.20 you might have used other measures to mitigate missing orders issue, for example by using `CHECKOUT_FULLY_PAID` webhook and calling `checkoutComplete` mutation on your backend.

After migrating to Saleor 3.20 and enabling this feature for all your channels, you can safely get rid of this workaround.

Keep in mind that `CHECKOUT_FULLY_PAID` webhook would have only been triggered if you also used `TransactionFlowStrategy.CHARGE` for your channel. Automatic checkout completion doesn't have this problem.

### Before you enable this feature


:::danger
Enabling this feature might break your current storefront implementation and services connected to Saleor that use `Checkout` object.
:::

Before you enable this feature make sure that you don't rely on any `Checkout` query or mutation that updates `Checkout` after transaction is created.

Automatic checkout completion works just like calling `checkoutComplete` mutation, which converts `Checkout` object into `Order`.

After completion `checkout` query with a `id` of already completed `Checkout` will return `null`.

:::tip
You can determine if checkout was automatically completed by making `checkout` query: 

```graphql
query CheckoutDetails($id: ID!) {
  checkout(id: $id) {
    id
    authorizeStatus
  }
}
```

If Saleor returns `null`, then you can assume that it was automatically completed:

```json
{
  "data": {
    "checkout": null
  },
}

```

If automatic checkout completion is not enabled in a `Channel`, storefront should `checkoutComplete` mutation, once `authorizeStatus` is set to `FULL`:

```json
{
  "data": {
    "checkout": {
      "id": "Q2hlY2tvdXQ6",
      "authorizeStatus": "FULL"
    }
  }
}
```
:::

:::tip
The checkout may not be automatically completed due to issues that arise during validation.

You can identify any existing problems using the `Checkout.problems` query.
For more information, refer to the [Checkout Problems page](/developer/checkout/problems).

:::

:::tip
To determine if `Checkout` was completed you can also rely on response from `transactionInitialize` or `transactionProcess` mutations by checking the `TransactionEvent` object returned in the mutation response.

Such transaction is considered successful in a context of a `Checkout` when the `TransactionEvent`'s `amount` is equal to `Checkout.totalPrice` and its `type` is one of these:

- `AUTHORIZATION_SUCCESS`
- `AUTHORIZATION_REQUEST`
- `CHARGE_SUCCESS`
- `CHARGE_REQUEST`

Note: payment provider might sometimes return **lower** amount than the one you have requested. In that case `Checkout` will not be paid.

Your logic also needs to take into consideration multiple transactions if you use split-payments. If you use them, it might be easier to make separate `checkout` query, described in previous section.
:::


In order to get the `Order` details after payment you can use:

1. **`checkoutComplete` mutation**

:::note
This query can be called directly by customers in a storefront.
:::

This mutation is idempotent, which means it can be called multiple times, but only one `Order` will be created. If `checkoutComplete` is invoked multiple times it will return the same `Order` object.

```graphql
mutation CompleteCheckout($id: ID!) {
  checkoutComplete(id: $id) {
    order {
      id
    }
  }
}
```

If `Checkout` has been paid, the response will contain `Order` object:
```json
{
  "data": {
    "checkoutComplete": {
      "order": {
        "id": "T3JkZXI6NzQ="
      }
    }
  }
}
```

If `Checkout` hasn't been paid, the response will contain an error:
```json
{
  "data": {
    "checkoutComplete": {
      "errors": [
        {
          "code": "CHECKOUT_NOT_FULLY_PAID"
        }
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

2. **`orders` query**

:::note
This query requires <span class="badge badge--danger">MANAGE_ORDERS</span> permission, it cannot be used directly by customers in a storefront.
:::

`orders` query filter, has an option to provide `checkoutIds` or `checkoutTokens` to get `Order` object that was created by specified `Checkout`:

```graphql
query OrderDetails($checkoutId: ID!) {
  orders(filter: {checkoutIds: [$checkoutId]}, first: 1) {
    edges {
      node {
        id
      }
    }
  }
}
```

```graphql
query OrderDetails($checkoutToken: UUID!) {
  orders(filter: {checkoutTokens: [$checkoutToken]}, first: 1) {
    edges {
      node {
        id
      }
    }
  }
}
```

:::warning
If you use [`orderCreateFromCheckout`](/api-reference/orders/mutations/order-create-from-checkout.mdx) mutation with parameter [`removeCheckout: false`](/api-reference/orders/mutations/order-create-from-checkout.mdx#ordercreatefromcheckoutremovecheckoutboolean--) multiple `Orders` may be created from a single `Checkout`.

Please note that this situation doesn't apply to `checkoutComplete` mutation or automatic checkout completions. Therefore, we can safely assume that only one `Order` can be created from `Checkout`. This is why this query uses `first: 1` parameter.
