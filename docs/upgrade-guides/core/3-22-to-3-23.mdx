title: Upgrading From 3.22 To 3.23
sidebar_position: 0

:::info
To follow a zero-downtime upgrade strategy to 3.23, **we recommend first migrating to the latest 3.22.x release** and enabling the Celery worker to process all data migrations asynchronously.
Otherwise, you will need to schedule downtime to ensure data migrations complete correctly.

## Dashboard extensions

Since 3.22, Dashboard extension manifests are validated on the frontend. Installing apps directly via GraphQL is discouraged, as such apps may not work properly.

**For Cloud users:** You should not be affected by these changes.

**For self-hosted:**
- Ensure you use the latest matching Dashboard versions. Early Dashboard v3.22.x releases are not compatible with later Core 3.22 versions. Dashboard v3.23.x and Core v3.23.x are fully compatible.
- Fields on type `AppExtension` and `AppExtensionManifest`: `mount`, `target`, and `options` have been removed. Use the fields `mountName`, `targetName`, and `settings` instead, which directly replace the old ones.
- New fields are intended to be used by Dashboard only. Modifying them requires caution and may require frontend adjustments.
- New fields are no longer strictly validated, which means installing an app extension *without* Dashboard can cause unexpected Dashboard behavior.
