title: Upgrading From 3.22 To 3.23

:::info
To follow the zero-downtime strategy when upgrading to 3.23, **It is recommended to first migrate to latest 3.22.X** and turn on the Celery worker to process all data migrations asynchronously.
Otherwise, you will need to downtime your solution to ensure correct data migration.

## Dashboard extensions

Since 3.22 Dashboard extension manifests are validated on the frontend. Installing apps directly via graphQL is discouraged, such apps may not work properly.

For Cloud users: you should not be affected

For self-hosted:
- Ensure you use latest matching Dashboard versions. Early Dashboard v3.22.x will not work with late Core 3.22. Dashboard v3.23.x and Core v3.23.x are fully compatible.
- Fields on type `AppExtension` and `AppExtensionManifest`: `mount`, `target` and `options` are removed. Use fields `mountName`, `targetName` and `settings`, which directly replace the old ones
- New fields are meant to be used by Dashboard only, changing them requires caution and frontend adjustments
- New fields are no longer strict, that means installation of the app extension *without* dashboard can cause unexpected Dashboard behavior
