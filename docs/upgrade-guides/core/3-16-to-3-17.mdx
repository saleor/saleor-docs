title: Upgrading From 3.16 To 3.17
sidebar_position: 5
---

:::info
To follow the zero-downtime strategy when upgrading to 3.17, **It is recommended to first migrate to at least 3.16.2** and turn on the Celery worker to process all data migrations asynchronously.
Otherwise, you will need to downtime your solution to ensure correct data migration.

## Migrating from NOTIFY_USER

Starting from Saleor 3.16, the `NOTIFY_USER` webhook event will be deprecated. If your app uses this webhook, you should migrate to dedicated webhook events. The following is a list of webhook events that replace specific notifications. All webhook events that replace `NOTIFY_USER` support [subscription queries](developer/extending/webhooks/subscription-webhook-payloads.mdx#custom-payloads), which allow you to define the payload you want to receive for your notifications.

The table below shows sub-types of `NOTIFY_USER` events (represented as the `notify_event` field in the legacy payloads), their GraphQL subscription replacements, and the Saleor version in which they were or will be introduced.

| NOTIFY_USER event                | Subscription                                                                                                                                                                      | Saleor version |

To migrate to new events, you need to create new webhooks in Saleor and provide subscription queries for the events you want to receive.

### Payload changes

Some fields that were available in the `NOTIFY_USER` payload are not available in subscription payloads of the new events:

- `domain` - the domain of the Saleor instance, can be fetched from the API using the [shop](api-reference/miscellaneous/queries/shop.mdx) query.
- `site_name` - same as above.
- `logo_url` - if needed, apps should handle providing the logo URL themselves.

## Deprecation of the `externalNotificationTrigger` mutation

Starting from Saleor 3.16, the [externalNotificationTrigger](api-reference/miscellaneous/objects/external-notification-trigger.mdx) mutation will be deprecated. Apps that send custom notifications should implement their own logic for this purpose.
