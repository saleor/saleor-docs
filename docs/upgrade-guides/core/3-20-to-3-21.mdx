title: Upgrading From 3.20 To 3.21
sidebar_position: 1
---

:::info
To follow the zero-downtime strategy when upgrading to 3.21, **It is recommended to first migrate to latest 3.20.X** and turn on the Celery worker to process all data migrations asynchronously.
Otherwise, you will need to downtime your solution to ensure correct data migration.
:::

## Authentication required for changing `Order` and `OrderLine` metadata

The [updateMetadata](/api-reference/miscellaneous/mutations/update-metadata.mdx) mutation for `Order` and `OrderLine` now requires the `MANAGE_ORDERS` permission.
Once an order is created, customers cannot edit its metadata. However, merchants and apps with the necessary permissions can modify this data.
Fetching metadata remains unchanged.

## Merging metadata in `transactionUpdate` mutation

The [transactionUpdate](/api-reference/payments/mutations/transaction-update.mdx) mutation now merges the provided metadata and private metadata with existing values, instead of overwriting them.
To delete a specific metadata entry, use the [deleteMetadata](/api-reference/miscellaneous/mutations/delete-metadata.mdx) mutation.
For private metadata, use the [deletePrivateMetadata](/api-reference/miscellaneous/mutations/delete-private-metadata.mdx) mutation.

## Deprecated `manager.perform_mutation` method

Note: This change only affects open-source Saleor users with custom plugins overriding the `perform_mutation` plugin method.

As part of gradual plugin deprecation, Saleor 3.20 deprecates the `perform_mutation` plugin hook. This method allowed to customize the mutation execution flow and call arbitrary logic during mutation execution. From now on, we recommend building such customizations via apps by reacting to webhooks triggered by mutations. The `perform_mutation` plugin method will be removed in Saleor 3.21.

## Deprecated `WebhookPlugin` and webhook-related plugin hooks

Note: This change only affects open-source Saleor users with custom plugins that override webhook-related plugin hooks (see the list below).

The `WebhookPlugin` is deprecated in Saleor 3.20 and will be removed in Saleor 3.21, as all webhook-related functionality will be moved from plugin to core modules. Rationale behind this change is that webhooks are essential part of Saleor and should be available out of the box, without the need for additional plugins. As a result, multiple plugin manager hooks will be deprecated, as they are only used by the `WebhookPlugin`.

If you have custom plugins that override any of the following plugin hooks, you should migrate your custom logic to Saleor App that listens to webhooks.

The list of deprecated plugin hooks is as follows:

* `account_change_email_requested`
* `account_confirmation_requested`
* `account_confirmed`

## `checkout.shippingMethods` and `checkout.availableShippingMethods` do not return external shipping methods if their currency differs from the checkout's currency

If an app subscribed to `SHIPPING_LIST_METHODS_FOR_CHECKOUT` returns an external shipping method with a currency different from the checkout's currency, Saleor will filter out that shipping method. As a result, external shipping methods with a different currency than the checkout's currency will not be returned via the API (in the checkout.shippingMethods and checkout.availableShippingMethods fields).
Any potential currency validation for external shipping methods on the frontend / app side is no longer necessary.



## Blocked external calls for checkout and order bulk queries

To enhance performance and efficiency, bulk queries that fetch multiple checkout or order objects will **no longer trigger external calls to third-party services**. The following synchronous webhooks will be affected:

- **`CHECKOUT_CALCULATE_TAXES`** webhooks
- **`ORDER_CALCULATE_TAXES`** webhooks
- **`SHIPPING_LIST_METHODS_FOR_CHECKOUT`** webhooks
- **`CHECKOUT_FILTER_SHIPPING_METHODS`** webhooks
- **`ORDER_FILTER_SHIPPING_METHODS`** webhooks

External calls from the **AvataxPlugin** will also be skipped.


Instead of recalculating taxes externally, the system will return **pre-stored prices** from the database. Additionally, only built-in shipping methods will be returned. The `CHECKOUT_FILTER_SHIPPING_METHODS` and `ORDER_FILTER_SHIPPING_METHODS` webhooks will not be triggered, and all built-in shipping methods will be listed as available.

Any external shipping methods assigned to the checkout will still be visible through denormalized data stored in the database.

#### Affected queries
The following queries will **not trigger external calls**:

- `checkouts(...)`
- `me.checkouts(...)`
- `checkoutLines(...)`
- `orders(...)`
- `me.orders(...)`
- `draftOrders(...)`

#### Example of impacted queries

```graphql
{
  checkouts(first: 10) {
    edges {
      node {
        id
        deliveryMethod {
          ... on ShippingMethod {
            id
            name
          }
        }
        shippingMethods {
          id
          name
        }
        totalPrice {
          gross {
            amount
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

```graphql
{
  orders(first: 100) {
    edges {
      node {
        deliveryMethod {
          ... on ShippingMethod {
            id
            name
          }
        }
        shippingMethods {
          id
          name
        }
        total {
          gross {
            amount
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

:::note
The `checkout` and `order` queries will still work as before. If tax information is outdated, external calls will be made to recalculate taxes. External shipping methods and filters will be fetched if necessary.
:::


## `checkout.privateMetadata` no longer stores `external-shipping-method-id`

The `external-shipping-method-id` is no longer stored within `checkout.privateMetadata`. To retrieve this ID, use the `checkout.deliveryMethod` field instead.


## `checkoutDeliveryMethodUpdate` and `checkoutShippingMethodUpdate` mutations do not trigger `CHECKOUT_UPDATED` webhook or tax invalidation when adding the same method already assigned

Previously, the `checkoutDeliveryMethodUpdate` and `checkoutShippingMethodUpdate` mutations would trigger the `CHECKOUT_UPDATED` webhook and invalidate taxes regardless of whether the same delivery method was already assigned to the checkout.
Starting from version 3.21, if the same method that is already assigned to the checkout is provided, the `CHECKOUT_UPDATED` webhook will not be triggered, and taxes will not be invalidated.
From Saleor's perspective, nothing has changed, as the checkout remains in the same state as it was before the mutation was called.
