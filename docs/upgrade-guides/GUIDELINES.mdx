# How to write an upgrade guide

## Guidelines

### Structure

The upgrade guide should be structured as follows:

1. Introduction/context (no heading)
2. Upgrade step for each breaking change (h2)

### Writing

Please try to be as concise as possible. The upgrade guide should be a quick reference for developers who want to upgrade their projects to the latest version. Focus on what could make the upgrading process easier for the developer: actionable items, tips, code snippets, etc.

## Example upgrade guide

This migration guide describes the upgrade from version 1.0.0 to 1.1.0. Version 1.1.0 contains the following breaking changes:

- The `ping` function has been removed.
- The `nft` property was removed from the `product` object.

:::caution

Before you start the upgrade, make sure you stop the server first and have a backup of your database.

:::

To successfully upgrade to version 1.1.0, you need to perform these steps:

`## The "ping" function has been removed`

In the previous versions, you would use the `ping` function to send an echo request to the Saleor API. In version 1.1.0, we removed the `ping` and introduced the alternative: `pong`. You can read more about the `pong` function in the API reference.

1. Find all references to the `ping` function in your codebase.
2. Replace them with the `pong` function.

`## The "nft" property was removed from the "product" object.`

In the previous versions, the `product` object contained the `nft` property. With version 1.1.0, we removed the `nft` property completely.

:::tip

To make the migration smoother, we suggest upgrading to 1.0.1 first.

:::

1. Run the database migrations.
2. Remove all the references to the `nft` property in your codebase.
