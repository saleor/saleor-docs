title: Payment Gateways

## Adding a new payment gateway

Saleor uses a universal flow that each gateway should implement by providing a class that contains all the necessary methods.
All of the plugin methods take `previous_value` as a second argument.
More information about `previous_value` can be found [here](developer/extending/plugins.mdx#base-plugin-class).

For a gateway to work correctly, you also need to specify `supported_currencies` in your gateway configuration.
It determines in which currencies the gateway can be used.

For more information on the plugin implementation methods and configurations of supported currencies,
see the `plugin.py` file for an existing payment gateway.

:::note
You will also need to integrate your payment gateway into your storefront’s code.
:::

### Client token

`get_client_token`: A client token is a signed data blob that includes configuration and authorization information required by the payment gateway.

Client tokens should not be reused; a new client token should be generated for each payment request.

:::note
All the payment methods receive `payment_information` as a dataclass: `PaymentData`.

You are in charge of configuring your gateway. Based on the existing implementations, you may use the `GatewayConfig` class to configure your plugin.

For more information on how to configure your plugin, see the [Plugins](dashboard/configuration/plugins/introduction.md) topic.

### Authorize payment

`authorize(payment_information)`: Authorization is a process of reserving the amount of money against the customer’s funding source. The money does not change hands until the authorization is captured.

### Refund

`refund(payment_information)`: A refund is a full or partial return of captured funds to the customer.

### Capture payment

`capture(payment_information)`: A transfer of the money that was reserved during the authorization stage.

### Void

`void(payment_information)`: A cancellation of a pending authorization or capture.

### Process payment

`process_payment(payment_information)`: Used for the checkout process, it should perform all the necessary steps to process a payment. It should use already-defined functions, like authorize and capture.
