## What is Saleor Cloud?

Saleor Cloud is a cloud-hosted, fully managed version of the Saleor platform. 
It operates as a **SaaS**, where Saleor handles infrastructure, performance, updates, and security so you can focus on building your store.

### Creating an Account

Saleor Cloud provides free test projects for experimentation and development purposes.

Sign up at [cloud.saleor.io](https://cloud.saleor.io/) and get started for free.

Access to cloud can be configured via SSO.

## Cloud Console

The Cloud Console is your central hub for managing all elements of Saleor Cloud. 
You can access it at [cloud.saleor.io](https://cloud.saleor.io/).
From here, you can manage organizations, projects, environments, billing, team access, or the Cloud Account itself via "Account Management Console".

### Organizations

An organization is the **top-level entity** in Saleor Cloud. 
It provides the structure for managing your projects, billing, and team collaboration. 
Every user must belong to at least one organization.

#### Key Concepts
- **Projects**: Each organization can contain multiple projects, which typically represent separate stores.  
- **Billing**: All projects within an organization share the same billing account, which simplifies financial management.
- **Teams & Permissions**: Invite staff members at the organization level and manage their access with fine-grained permissions.
You can grant full access to the entire organization or restrict it to specific areas, such as only managing sandbox environments.  

If you are a new user and aren't invited to an existing organization, the platform will prompt you to create your own during the onboarding process.

#### Multiple Organizations

Users can belong to multiple organizations at the same time. This is particularly useful for:

- **Agencies & Freelancers:** Work with various client organizations, each with their own projects and billing, without mixing data.

- **Personal vs. Professional Separation:** Keep your own personal or experimental projects in a separate organization from your employer's or clients' projects.

The following example shows how organizations can be structured:

```text
Organization: ACME Inc
  ├── Project: ACME US Store
  │     ├── Sandbox Dev
  │     ├── Sandbox Staging
  │     └── Production
  ├── Project: ACME EU Store
  │     ├── Sandbox
  │     └── Production
Organization: Freelance Playground
  └── Project: Side Hustle Store
        └── Sandbox
```


### Projects

Projects contains backend instances and have staff access control. 
Each project can have a single production environment and multiple developer environments called sandboxes.
Projects are meant to be treated as individual shops, where backup data and snapshots are meant to be interchangeable between environments. 
For example, you can create [snapshot](/cloud/environment.mdx#snapshots) of your production environment and restore it to the staging sandbox environment.

Each project is bound to a single AWS region.

### Environments

Environments aka backend can be either production (one per project) or sandboxes meant for development purposes. Learn more about [environments](/cloud/environment.mdx).

## Configuration and Management

Once you have your Saleor Cloud account set up, you'll need to configure various aspects of your organization and projects. 
This includes managing team members, setting up billing, and configuring security settings.

### Key Configuration Areas

- **Team Management**: Invite staff members, assign permissions, and manage access levels for different parts of your cloud infrastructure.
- **Organization Settings**: Configure contact information, billing addresses, and primary communication channels.
- **Billing Configuration**: Set up payment methods, manage VAT information, and handle invoicing.
- **Personal Settings**: Configure multi-factor authentication, manage access tokens, and monitor account activity.

For detailed information about configuring these aspects, see our [Configuration Guide](/cloud/configuration.mdx).
