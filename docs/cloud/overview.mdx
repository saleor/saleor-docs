### Creating an Account

Saleor cloud provides free test projects for experimentation and development purposes.

Signup at [cloud.saleor.io](https://cloud.saleor.io/) to get started for free.

Sandboxes can be later promoted to production by adding credit card details.

### Organizations

Organizations allow to create multiple projects under the same billing account and invite staff members across all projects.
If you are not invited to an existing organization, open the [Saleor Cloud dashboard](https://cloud.saleor.io/) after registration. As every user must be assigned to an organization, you should see the organization creation form right away.

Access to organization and projects can be configured via SSO.

### Projects

Projects contains backend instances and have staff access control. Each project can have a single production environment and multiple developer environments called sandboxes.
Projects are meant to be treated as individual shops, where backup data and snapshots are meant to be interchangeable between environments. For example, you can create [snapshot](/cloud/environment.mdx#snapshots) of your production environment and restore it to the staging sandbox environment.

Each project is bound to a single AWS region.

### Environments

Environments aka backend can be either production (one per project) or sandboxes meant for development purposes. Learn more about [environments](/cloud/environment.mdx).
