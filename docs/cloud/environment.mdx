### Production vs Sandbox

Unlike _Sandboxes_, the _Production_ environment doesn't have limitations on _rate limiting_ and resource usage, such as orders, API requests, products, etc.

The limits imposed on sandboxes are displayed in the Cloud Console.

### Snapshots

Database snapshots can be created and replicated from any sandbox or production environment, allowing staging environments to be created.

This feature enables productive workflows for development and testing, for example:

- Replicating the latest production data to a staging environment.
- Creating integration tests. You can create snapshots that would be used as a starting point for integration tests.
- Migration scripts. During the development of migration scripts, it might be desirable to do it in steps, where each successful step can be saved and reverted during the development of the next step.

Follow the quickstart guide to learn [how to use snapshots](/quickstart/cloud.mdx).

### Version upgrades

Saleor versions can be upgraded on demand via the console. Sequential upgrades (from one minor to the next minor) are backward compatible and do not require downtime. Thus, upgrades are never disruptive.

Each environment has independent version management, thus making it possible to test new features before production upgrades.

:::note
Projects without a production environment (aka free projects) automatically upgrade to the latest version. To disable automatic version upgrades of sandboxes, you would need to have a production instance in the same project.

### Access Control

To control `Trusted client origins` and `Allowed API origins`, see the guide for [API access restriction](/cloud/restricting-api-access.mdx).


### Subdomain Management

Subdomains of your environments (e.g., `[your_subdomain].saleor.cloud`) can be changed of your instance on demand via console.
