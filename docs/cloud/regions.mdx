When creating your shop on Saleor Cloud, you can choose to host it in one of the following primary regions:

| Primary Region (Country)    | Cloud Provider / Code             | Secondary (Failover) Region        |
| --------------------------- | --------------------------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| Europe - Ireland            | Amazon Web Services - `eu-west-1` | Europe - France (`eu-west-3`)      |
| United States - N. Virginia | Amazon Web Services - `us-east-1` | United States - Ohio (`us-east-2`) |

:::note
Data is strictly isolated between regions. For example, `eu-west-1` never
shares data with `us-east-1`, and the reverse is also true.
:::

Data is replicated from the primary to the secondary region (free of charge)
as part of our disaster recovery strategies. These secondary regions act as fallback
locations if a primary region becomes unavailable for an extended duration to ensure
your business can resume its operations.
