This guide covers aspects of configuring and managing your Saleor Cloud account, 
including organization settings, team management, billing configuration, and personal account settings.

## Staff Members

Each organization can have multiple staff members with different permission levels. 

### Lifecycle Management

- **Invite**: Send invitations via email to new team members.
- **Deactivate**: Temporarily disable access without removing the user.
- **Remove**: Permanently remove users from the organization.

To access the Cloud Console, users must belong to or own at least one organization. 
If a user is removed or deactivated from their last organization, they will be prompted to create a new organization upon their next login.

:::info
If a user already has a Cloud account and accepts an invitation to a new organization, 
they will see the new organization in their organization list in the top-left corner of the console.
