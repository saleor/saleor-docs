This guide covers aspects of configuring and managing your Saleor Cloud account, 
including organization settings, team management, billing configuration, and personal account settings.

## Staff Members

Each organization can have multiple staff members with different permission levels. 

### Lifecycle Management

- **Invite**: Send invitations via email to new team members.
- **Deactivate**: Temporarily disable access without removing the user.
- **Remove**: Permanently remove users from the organization.

:::info
If a user already has a Cloud account and accepts an invitation to a new organization, 
they will see the new organization in their organization list in the top-left corner of the console.

:::warning
When a user is deactivated or removed from their last organization, they will see a form to create a new organization upon their next login.

### Permissions

You can expand or restrict each member's permissions to access specific parts of the Saleor Cloud system:

- **Grant full access to Saleor Cloud**: Complete administrative access.
- **View Resources**: Read-only access to view projects, environments, and staff members list. Staff with this permission cannot log in to the dashboard.
- **Manage Team**: Ability to invite, remove, and manage other team members. Users with this permission can only assign permissions that they have.
- **Manage Finances**: Access to billing information and payment methods.
- **Edit Organization**: Modify organization settings and contact information.
- **Manage Projects**: Create, modify, and delete projects.
- **Manage Production Environments**: Full control over production environment settings.
- **Manage Sandbox Environments**: Control over development and staging environments.

## Organization Settings

The organization settings contain essential information for your account management and billing.

### Contact Information

- **Primary Email**: All emails regarding your organization account will be sent here. This can be the same email address you used to sign up. 
When environments, projects, or organizations are flagged for suspension, Saleor will send notifications to this email.
- **Billing Email**: This address receives all billing-related communications. If no billing email is specified, all billing information will be sent to the admin email.


### Address Information

Your organization's address will be used for creating invoices.

## Billing

The billing section contains invoices and billing information for each project within your organization.

### Payment Configuration

- **Payment Method**: Provide payment card data for automatic billing.
- **VAT Number**: If you are registered as a VAT company in the EU legal system, you must share your VAT number with Saleor Cloud. We use this information only to help us file taxes in the EU.

## Personal Configuration

Manage your individual account settings and preferences.

### Profile Information

Update your personal data including:
- First name
- Last name
- Phone number

### Access Token

Your access token is used to manage the cloud console programmatically.
