title: SaaS vs Self-Hosting
---

## No Vendor Lock-in

Typically, the SaaS model offers organizations convenience of limited responsibility at the cost of limited control.

We believe users should not be forced to compromise on either. Infrastructure needs can evolve, so we enable a straightforward migration path between Cloud and on-premise infrastructure.

## You Own Your Data

We claim no ownership or rights to the data you store beyond what's necessary to render the services. You remain the owner and administrator of your product data, customer data, orders placed, and any additional data you choose to store in the system.

Saleor Commerce is headquartered in Europe and is committed to providing solutions that prioritize privacy in accordance with GDPR, the EU AI Act, CCPA, CPRA, and other relevant legislation that protects you and your customers.
