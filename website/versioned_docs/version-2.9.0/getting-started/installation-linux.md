## Prerequisites

Before you are ready to run Saleor, you will need additional software installed on your computer.

### Python 3

Saleor requires Python version 3.6 or later. A compatible version comes pre-installed with most current Linux systems. If not, consult your Linux distributor for instructions on how to install Python 3.6 or 3.7.

### Node.js

Version 10 or later is required. See the [installation instructions](https://nodejs.org/en/download/package-manager/).

### PostgreSQL

Saleor needs PostgreSQL version 9.4 or above to work. Use the [PostgreSQL download page](https://www.postgresql.org/download/) to get instructions for your distribution.

### GTK+

Some features (for example, PDF creation) require that additional system libraries are present.

- Debian / Ubuntu

Debian 9.0 Stretch or newer, Ubuntu 16.04 Xenial or newer:

```shell-session
sudo apt-get install build-essential python3-dev python3-pip python3-cffi libcairo2 libpango-1.0-0 libpangocairo-1.0-0 libgdk-pixbuf2.0-0 libffi-dev shared-mime-info
```

- Fedora

```shell-session
sudo yum install redhat-rpm-config python-devel python-pip python-cffi libffi-devel cairo pango gdk-pixbuf2
```

- Arch Linux

```shell-session
sudo pacman -S python-pip cairo pango gdk-pixbuf2 libffi pkg-config
```

- Gentoo

```shell-session
emerge pip cairo pango gdk-pixbuf cffi
```

## Installation

### 1. Clone the repository (or use your own fork)

```shell-session
git clone https://github.com/mirumee/saleor.git
```

### 2. Enter the directory

```shell-session
cd saleor/
```

### 3. Install all dependencies

We strongly recommend [creating a virtual environment](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/venv.html) before installing any Python packages.

```shell-session
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 4. Set `SECRET_KEY` environment variable

We try to provide usable default values for all the settings. We have decided not to provide a default for `SECRET_KEY` as we fear someone would inevitably ship a project with the default value left in code.

```shell-session
export SECRET_KEY='<mysecretkey>'
```

:::warning
The secret key should be a unique string that only your team knows. Running the code with a known `SECRET_KEY` defeats many of Django’s security protections; it can also lead to privilege escalation and remote code execution vulnerabilities. Consult [Django’s documentation](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.11/ref/settings/#secret-key) for details.
:::

### 5. Create a PostgreSQL user

See PostgreSQL’s [createuser command](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/static/app-createuser.html) for details.

Unless configured otherwise, the store will use `saleor` as both the username and password. Remember to assign your user the `SUPERUSER` privilege. This will allow you to create databases and database extensions.

:::warning
While creating the database, Django will need to create some PostgreSQL extensions if they are not already present. This requires superuser privileges.

For local development you can grant your database user the `SUPERUSER` privilege. For publicly available systems, we recommend using a separate privileged user to perform database migrations.
:::

### 6. Create a PostgreSQL database

See [PostgreSQL’s createdb command](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/static/app-createdb.html) for details.

:::note
The database name is extracted from the `DATABASE_URL` environment variable. If absent, it defaults to `saleor`.
:::

### 7. Prepare the database

```shell-session
python manage.py migrate
```

:::warning
This command creates database extensions. If you get an error related to the `CREATE EXTENSION` command, please return to the instructions in the PostgreSQL user creation step.
:::

### 8. Install front-end dependencies

```shell-session
npm install
```

:::note
If this step fails, make sure you are using a recent version of Node.js.
:::

### 9. Prepare front-end assets

```shell-session
npm run build-assets
```

### 10. Compile e-mails

```shell-session
npm run build-emails
```

### 11. Start the development server

```shell-session
python manage.py runserver
```
