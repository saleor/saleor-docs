## Pulling Translations From Transifex

First make sure you have the Transifex command-line client installed by `python -m pip install transifex-client` or `python -m pip install -r requirements_dev.txt`. For Pipenv users, it can also be installed by `pipenv install --dev`.

Then use the pull command to pull translations:

```shell-session
$ tx pull
```

> **Note:**
>
> To create locale directories for newly created translations you will need to call `tx pull` with the `--all` flag.


## Compiling Message Catalogs

This is required for Django to see the translations.

```shell-session
$ python manage.py compilemessages
```

> **Note**
>
> On Windows, you will need to install GNU’s `gettext` command. To do that you need to install [gettext-iconv](https://mlocati.github.io/articles/gettext-iconv-windows.html). During the installation, make sure to check “**Add to PATH**”.
>
> Don’t forget to restart your terminal or software after the installation to take the changes into effect.


## Extracting Messages to Translate

This will update the English language files with messages that appear in your code.

For the backend code and templates:

```shell-session
$ python manage.py makemessages -l en --extension=email,html,mjml,py,txt --ignore="templates/templated_email/compiled/*"
```

For JavaScript code:

```shell-session
$ python manage.py makemessages -l en -d djangojs --ignore="_build/*" --ignore="node_modules/*" --ignore="saleor/static/assets/*"
```
