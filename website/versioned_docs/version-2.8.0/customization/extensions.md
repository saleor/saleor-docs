Saleor has implemented extensions architecture. It includes hooks for most basic operations like calculation of prices in the checkout or calling some actions when an order has been created.


## Plugin

Saleor has some plugins implemented by default. These plugins are located in `saleor.core.extensions.plugins`. The ExtensionManager needs to receive a list of enabled plugins. It can be done by including the Python plugin path in the `settings.PLUGINS` list.


### Writing Your Own Plugin

A custom plugin has to inherit from the `BasePlugin` class. It should overwrite base methods. The plugin needs to be added to the `settings.PLUGINS` Your own plugin can be written as a class which has callable instances, like this:

```python
custom/plugin.py

from django.conf import settings
from urllib.parse import urljoin

from ...base_plugin import BasePlugin
from .tasks import api_post_request_task

class CustomPlugin(BasePlugin):
    def __init__(self, *args, **kwargs):
        super().__init__(*args, **kwargs)
        self._enabled = bool(settings.CUSTOM_PLUGIN_KEYS)


    def postprocess_order_creation(self, order: "Order", previous_value: Any):
        if not self._enabled:
            return
        data = {}

        transaction_url = urljoin(settings.CUSTOM_API_URL, "transactions/createoradjust")
        api_post_request_task.delay(transaction_url, data)
```

> **Note**
>
> There is no need to implement all base methods. `ExtensionManager` will use default values for methods that are not implemented.


### Activating Plugin

To activate the plugin, add it to the `PLUGINS` list in your Django settings:

```python
# settings.py

PLUGINS = ["saleor.core.extensions.plugins.custom.CustomPlugin", ]
```


## `ExtensionsManager`

`ExtensionsManager` is located in the `saleor.core.extensions.base_plugin`. It is a class responsible for handling all declared plugins and serving a response from them. It serves a default response in case of a non-declared plugin. There is a possibility to overwrite an `ExtensionsManager` class by implementing it on its own. Saleor will discover the manager class by taking the declared path from `settings.EXTENSIONS_MANAGER`. Each Django request object has its own manager included as the `extensions` field. It is attached in the Saleor middleware.


## BasePlugin

`BasePlugin` is located in the `saleor.core.extensions.base_plugin`. It is an abstract class for storing all methods available for any plugin. All methods take the `previous_value` parameter. This contains a value calculated by the previous plugin in the queue. If the plugin is first in line, it will use the default value calculated by the manager.


## Celery Tasks

Some plugin operations should be done asynchronously. If Saleor has Celery enabled, it will discover all tasks declared in tasks.py in the plugin directories.


### `plugin.py`

```python
def postprocess_order_creation(self, order: "Order", previous_value: Any):
    if not self._enabled:
        return
    data = {}
    transaction_url = urljoin(get_api_url(), "transactions/createoradjust")

    api_post_request_task.delay(transaction_url, data)
```


### `tasks.py`

```python
import json
from celery import shared_task
from typing import Any, Dict

import requests
from requests.auth import HTTPBasicAuth
from django.conf import settings


@shared_task
def api_post_request(
    url: str,
    data: Dict[str, Any],
):
    try:
        username = "username"
        password = "password"
        auth = HTTPBasicAuth(username, password)
        requests.post(url, auth=auth, data=json.dumps(data), timeout=settings.TIMEOUT)
    except requests.exceptions.RequestException:
        return
```
