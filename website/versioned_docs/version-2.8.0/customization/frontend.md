All static assets live in subdirectories of `/saleor/static/`.

Stylesheets are written in [Sass](http://sass-lang.com/) and rely on [postcss](http://postcss.org/) and [autoprefixer](https://autoprefixer.github.io/) for cross-browser compatibility.

JavaScript code is written according to the ES2015 standard and relies on [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for transpilation and browser-specific polyfills.

Everything is compiled together using [webpack module bundler](https://webpack.github.io/).

The resulting files are written to `/saleor/static/assets/` and should not be edited manually.

During development itâ€™s very convenient to have webpack automatically track changes made locally. This will also enable source maps that are extremely helpful when debugging.

To run webpack in _watch_ mode run:

```console
$ npm start
```

> **Warning**
>
> Files produced this way are not ready for production use. To prepare static assets for deployment run:
>
> ```console
> $ npm run build-assets --production
> ```
