title: Using Docker for Development
original_id: docker
---

Using Docker to build software allows you to run and test code without having to worry about external dependencies such as cache servers and databases.

> **Warning**
>
> The following setup is only meant for local development. See [Docker](deployment/docker.md) for production use of Docker.


## Local Prerequisites

You will need to install [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/install/) and [docker-compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/) before performing the following steps.

> **Note**
>
> Our configuration uses [docker-compose.override.yml](https://docs.docker.com/compose/extends/#understanding-multiple-compose-files) that exposes Saleor, PostgreSQL and Redis ports and runs Saleor via `python manage.py runserver` for local development. If you do not wish to use any overrides then you can tell compose to only use docker-compose.yml configuration using `-f`, like so: `docker-compose -f docker-compose.yml up`.


## Using local assets

By default we do not mount assets for development in the Docker, reason being is those are built in the Docker at build-time and arenâ€™t present in the cloned repository, so what was built on the Docker would be overshadowed by empty directories from the host.

However, we do know that there might be a case that you wish to mount them and see your changes reflected in the container, thus before proceeding you need to modify docker-compose.override.yml.

In order for Docker to use your assets from the host, you need to remove `/app/saleor/static/assets` volume and add `./webpack-bundle.json:/app/webpack-bundle.json` volume.

Additionally if you wish to have the compiled templated emails mounted then you need to also remove `/app/templates/templated_email/compiled` volume from web and celery services.


## Usage

Build the containers using `docker-compose`:

```console
$ docker-compose build
```

Prepare the database:

```console
$ docker-compose run --rm web python3 manage.py migrate
$ docker-compose run --rm web python3 manage.py collectstatic
$ docker-compose run --rm web python3 manage.py populatedb --createsuperuser
```

> The --createsuperuser argument creates an admin account for admin@example.com with the password set to admin.

Run the containers:

```console
$ docker-compose up
```

By default, the application is started in debug mode and is configured to listen on port `8000`.
