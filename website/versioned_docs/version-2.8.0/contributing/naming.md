To keep a consistent code structure we follow some rules when naming files.


## Python Modules

Try to have the name reflect the function of the file. If possible avoid generic file names such as `utils.py`.


## Django Templates

Use underscore as a word separator.


## Static Files

Use dashes to separate words as they end up as part of the URL.
