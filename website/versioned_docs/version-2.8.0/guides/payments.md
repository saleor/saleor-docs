## Integrating a new Payment Gateway into Saleor

We are using a universal flow, that each gateway should fulfill, there are several methods that should be implemented.

Your changes should live under the `saleor.payment.gateways.<gateway name>` module.

> **Note**
>
> After completing those steps you will also need to integrate your payment gateway into your SPA Storefront’s workflow.


### `get_client_token(config)`

A client token is a signed data blob that includes configuration and authorization information required by the payment gateway.

These should not be reused; a new client token should be generated for each payment request.


#### Example

```python
def get_client_token(config: GatewayConfig) -> str:
    gateway = get_payment_gateway(**config.connection_params)
    client_token = gateway.client_token.generate()
    return client_token
```

> **Note**
>
> All the below functions receive `payment_information` as a dataclass: `PaymentData` and `config` as a dataclass: `GatewayConfig`. Those functions should return a response as a dataclass: `GatewayResponse`. The description of the given structures can be found below.


### `authorize(payment_information, config)`

A process of reserving the amount of money against the customer’s funding source. Money does not change hands until the authorization is captured.


#### Example

```python
def authorize(
        payment_information: PaymentData,
        config: GatewayConfig,
    ) -> GatewayResponse:

    # Handle connecting to the gateway and sending the auth request here
    response = gateway.authorize(token=payment_information.token)

    # Return a correct response format so Saleor can process it,
    # the response must be json serializable
    return GatewayResponse(
        is_success=response.is_success,
        transaction_id=response.transaction.id,
        kind=TransactionKind.AUTH,
        amount=response.amount,
        currency=response.currency,
        error=get_error(response),
        raw_response=get_payment_gateway_response(response),
    )
```


### `refund(payment_information, config)`

Full or partial return of captured funds to the customer.

#### Example

```python
def refund(
    payment_information: PaymentData,
    config: GatewayConfig,
) -> GatewayResponse:

    # Handle connecting to the gateway and sending the refund request here
    response = gateway.refund(token=payment_information.token)

    # Return a correct response format so Saleor can process it,
    # the response must be json serializable
    return GatewayResponse(
        is_success=response.is_success,
        transaction_id=response.transaction.id,
        kind=TransactionKind.REFUND,
        amount=response.amount,
        currency=response.currency,
        error=get_error(response),
        raw_response=get_payment_gateway_response(response),
    )
```


### `capture(payment_information, config)`

A transfer of the money that was reserved during the authorization stage.


#### Example

```python
def capture(
    payment_information: PaymentData,
    config: GatewayConfig,
) -> GatewayResponse:

    # Handle connecting to the gateway and sending the capture request here
    response = gateway.capture(token=payment_information.token)

    # Return a correct response format so Saleor can process it,
    # the response must be json serializable
    return GatewayResponse(
        is_success=response.is_success,
        transaction_id=response.transaction.id,
        kind=TransactionKind.CAPTURE,
        amount=response.amount,
        currency=response.currency,
        error=get_error(response),
        raw_response=get_payment_gateway_response(response),
    )
```


### `void(payment_information, config)`

A cancellation of a pending authorization or capture.


#### Example

```python
def void(
    payment_information: PaymentData,
    config: GatewayConfig,
) -> GatewayResponse:

    # Handle connecting to the gateway and sending the void request here
    response = gateway.void(token=payment_information.token)

    # Return a correct response format so Saleor can process it,
    # the response must be json serializable
    return GatewayResponse(
        is_success=response.is_success,
        transaction_id=response.transaction.id,
        kind=TransactionKind.VOID,
        amount=response.amount,
        currency=response.currency,
        error=get_error(response),
        raw_response=get_payment_gateway_response(response),
    )
```


### `charge(payment_information, config)`

Authorization and capture in a single step.


#### Example

```python
def charge(
    payment_information: PaymentData,
    config: GatewayConfig,
) -> GatewayResponse:

    # Handle connecting to the gateway and sending the charge request here
    response = gateway.charge(
        token=payment_information.token,
        amount=payment_information.amount,
    )

    # Return a correct response format so Saleor can process it,
    # the response must be json serializable
    return GatewayResponse(
        is_success=response.is_success,
        transaction_id=response.transaction.id,
        kind=TransactionKind.CHARGE,
        amount=response.amount,
        currency=response.currency,
        error=get_error(response),
        raw_response=get_payment_gateway_response(response),
    )
```


### `process_payment(payment_information, config)`

Used for the checkout process, it should perform all the necessary steps to process a payment. It should use already defined functions, like authorize and capture.


#### Example

```python
def process_payment(
    payment_information: PaymentData,
    config: GatewayConfig,
) -> GatewayResponse:

    # Authorize, update the token, then capture
    authorize_response = authorize(payment_information, config)
    payment_information.token = authorize_response.transaction_id

    capture_response = capture(payment_information, config)

    return capture_response
```

## Handling errors

Gateway-specific errors should be parsed to Saleor’s universal format. More on this can be found in [Payments Architecture](architecture/payments.md).


## Adding payment method to the old checkout (optional)

If you are not using SPA Storefront, there are some additional steps you need to perform in order to enable the payment method in your checkout flow.


### Add a Form

Payment on the storefront will be handled via payment form, it should implement all the steps necessary for the payment to succeed. The form must implement `get_payment_token` that returns a token required to process payments. All payment forms should inherit from `django.forms.Form`.

Your changes should live under `saleor.payment.gateways.<gateway name>.forms.py`.


#### Example

```python
class BraintreePaymentForm(forms.Form):
    amount = forms.DecimalField()
    payment_method_nonce = forms.CharField()

    def get_payment_token(self):
        return self.cleaned_data["payment_method_nonce"]
```


### Implement `create_form(data, payment_information, connection_params)`

Should return the form that will be used for the checkout process.

> **Note**
>
> Should be added as a part of the provider’s methods.


#### Example

```python
def create_form(data, payment_information, connection_params):
    return BraintreePaymentForm(
        data,
        payment_information,
        connection_params,
    )
```

### Implement `template_path`

Should specify a path to a template that will be rendered for the checkout.

```python
PAYMENT_GATEWAYS = {
    DUMMY: {
        "module": "saleor.payment.gateways.dummy",
        "config": {
            "auto_capture": True,
            "connection_params": {},
            "template_path": "order/payment/dummy.html",
        },
    },
}
```


### Add template

Add a new template to handle the payment process with your payment form. Your changes should live under `saleor.templates.order.payment.<gateway name>.html`.


## Adding new payment gateway to the settings

```python
PAYMENT_GATEWAYS = {
    "braintree": {
        "module": "saleor.payment.gateways.braintree",
        "config": {
            "auto_capture": get_bool_from_env("BRAINTREE_AUTO_CAPTURE", True),
            "store_card": get_bool_from_env("BRAINTREE_STORE_CARD", False),
            "template_path": "order/payment/braintree.html",
            "connection_params": {
                "sandbox_mode": get_bool_from_env("BRAINTREE_SANDBOX_MODE", True),
                "merchant_id": os.environ.get("BRAINTREE_MERCHANT_ID"),
                "public_key": os.environ.get("BRAINTREE_PUBLIC_KEY"),
                "private_key": os.environ.get("BRAINTREE_PRIVATE_KEY"),
            },
        },
    },
}
```

Please take a moment to consider the example settings above.

- `braintree` - Gateway’s name, which will be used to identify the gateway during the payment process. It’s stored in the Payment model under the gateway value.
- `module` - The path to the integration module (assuming that your changes live within the `saleor.payment.gateways.braintree.__init__.py` file)
- `connection_params` - List of parameters used for connecting to the payment’s gateway.
- `auto_capture`- Define if the gateway should also capture funds from the card. When `auto_capture` is set to `False`, funds will be blocked by the customer’s bank for a 7-days period, a manual capture will be required.

> **Note**
>
> All payment backends default to using sandbox mode. This is very useful for development but make sure you use production mode when deploying to a production server.


## Enabling new payment gateway

Last but not least, if you want to enable your payment gateway in the checkout process, add it’s name to the `CHECKOUT_PAYMENT_GATEWAYS` setting.


## Tips

Whenever possible, use `currency` and `amount` as **returned** by the payment gateway, not the one that was sent to it. It might happen, that gateway (eg. Braintree) is set to different currency than your shop is. In such case, you might want to charge the customer 70 dollars, but due to gateway misconfiguration, he will be charged 70 euros. Such a situation should be handled, and adequate error should be thrown.
