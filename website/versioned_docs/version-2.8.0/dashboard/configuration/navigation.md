The navigation section allows you to configure what information is visible on the header and footer navigation bars of your website.

### Creating Your Navigation Structure

Creating the navigation structure is done by dragging and dropping. Simply create a new menu item and then drag it to the desired place. You can move items inside one another to create a tree structure and drag items up and down to create a hierarchy.

When you have more than one layer, the property to the far left will appear as the main item and the indented items become sub-elements, as in the following example.

### Managing Navigation Items

You can easily view, edit, or remove menu items using the icons on the right side of the sliders.
