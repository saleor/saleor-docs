## Setting Permissions

In the example above, the Permissions card has the box checked which reads [[User&nbsp;has&nbsp;full&nbsp;access&nbsp;to&nbsp;the&nbsp;store]]. If you want to limit access, uncheck the box and a list of different possible administrative activities will appear. Use the checkboxes to assign specific permissions to the user.

New users are automatically active in the system. To deactivate a userâ€™s access without deleting the account, uncheck the [[User&nbsp;is&nbsp;Active]] box in the Account Status card.


## Editing and Deleting Users

To edit a user account, access it from the staff members list, make any relevant changes, and then click [[Save]] in the footer.

To delete a user, click [[Remove]] on the left side of the footer and then confirm removal.
