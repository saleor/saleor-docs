In the footer of your main storefront, you can display informational pages with content about your store, your team, terms and conditions, privacy information, and other useful details. These simple text pages enhance the image of your business and sometimes contain essential legal information you need to communicate to customers.

To add pages, click on the [[Pages]] field in the Configure section of the dashboard. 
Click [[Add&nbsp;Page]] at the top right.

## General Information

Fill in the title of the page, as it will appear in the footer of your store. Keep it short, preferably just a word or two. 

Add the content that the page will contain. This may be a simple description of your store or a full terms and conditions section. Use the word processor formatting tools to adjust font sizes, add hyperlinks, and style the page as you want it to appear.

## Search Engine Preview

Click [[Edit&nbsp;Website&nbsp;SEO]] to add a description that will appear in web searches.


## URL

If you leave the URL card empty, the title of the page will be added to your normal site URL after a slash. You can change the site address after the slash by typing it into the URL field.


## Visibility

You can choose if your page is published or not. If the slider is green, it is live on your website. If the slider is grey, you can leave the page hidden or set a future date when it will be published.


## Deleting Pages

To delete a page, click on the checkbox next to the page name on the list, then click the trash can icon. Alternatively, you can enter the page and then click [[Remove]] in the footer.
