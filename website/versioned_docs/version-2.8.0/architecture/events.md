## Events Design

Each package representing an entity (order, account, etc.) that generate events define both a model and a `events.py` file containing a set of functions having `_event` for suffix.

Those functions are taking care of any logic and required fields for creating given events.


## Creating Events

To send an event, simply do the following:

```python
from saleor.order import events

# returns an OrderEvent
events.note_added_event(order=order, user=user, message="hello world!")
```

If now you want to send a ‘sent email’ event you would do the following:

```python
from saleor.order import events

events.email_sent_event(
    order=order,
    user=user,
    email_type=events.OrderEventsEmails.TRACKING_UPDATED,
)
```

Notice how we are providing the email type.

> **Note**
>
> The methods are using a `model_action_event` naming pattern.
