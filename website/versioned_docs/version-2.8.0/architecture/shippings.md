Saleor uses the concept of Shipping Zones and Shipping Methods to fulfill the shipping process.


## Shipping Zones

The countries that you ship to are known as the shipping zones. Each `ShippingZone` includes `ShippingMethods` that apply to customers whose shipping address is within the shipping zone.

Each `ShippingZone` can contain several countries inside, but the country might belong to a maximum of one `ShippingZone`.

Some examples of the `ShippingZones` could be European Union, North America, Germany etc.

There’s also a possibility to create a default Shipping Zone which will be used for countries not covered by other zones.


## Shipping Methods

`ShippingMethods` are the methods you’ll use to get customers’ orders to them. You can offer several ones within one `ShippingZone` to ensure the varieties of delivery speed and costs at the checkout.

Each `ShippmentMethod` could be one of the two types:

- `PRICE_BASED` - Those methods can be used only when the order price is within the certain range, eg. from 0 to 50$, 50$ and up etc.
- `WEIGHT_BASED` - Same as the `PRICE_BASED`, but with the total order’s weight in mind.

These methods allow you to cover most of the basic use cases, eg.:

- Listing several methods with different prices and shipping time for different countries.
- Offering a free (or discounted) shipping on orders above certain price threshold.
- Increasing the shipping price for heavy orders.


## Weight

Weight is used to calculate the `WEIGHT_BASED` shipping price.

Weight is defined on the `ProductType` level and can be overridden for each `Product` and each `ProductVariant` within a `Product`.
