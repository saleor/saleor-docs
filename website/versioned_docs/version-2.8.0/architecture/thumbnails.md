Saleor uses [`VersatileImageField`](https://github.com/respondcreate/django-versatileimagefield) replacement for Django’s ImageField. For performance reasons, in non-debug mode thumbnails are pregenerated by the worker’s task, fired after saving the instance. Accessing missing image will result in 404 error.

In debug mode thumbnails are generated on demand.


## Generating Products Thumbnails Manually

Create missing thumbnails for all ProductImage instances.

```console
$ python manage.py create_thumbnails
```


## Deleting Images

Image renditions are not deleted automatically with the Image instance, so is the main image. More on deleting images can be found in [`VersatileImageField` documentation](https://django-versatileimagefield.readthedocs.io/en/latest/deleting_created_images.html).
