Each product variant has a stock keeping unit (SKU).

Each variant holds information about quantity at hand, quantity allocated for already placed orders and quantity available.

**Example:** There are five boxes of shoes. Three of them have already been sold to customers but were not yet dispatched for shipment. The stock records **quantity** is **5**, **quantity allocated** is **3** and **quantity available** is **2**.

Each variant also has a _cost price_ (the price that your store had to pay to obtain it).


## Product Availability

A variant is in stock if it has unallocated quantity.

The highest quantity that can be ordered is the available quantity in product variant.


## Allocating Stock for New Orders

Once an order is placed, quantity needed to fulfil each order line is immediately marked as allocated.

**Example:** A customer places an order for another box of shoes. The stock records **quantity** is **5**, **quantity allocated** is now **4** and **quantity available** becomes **1**.


## Decreasing Stock After Shipment

Once order lines are marked as shipped, each corresponding stock record will have both its quantity at hand and quantity allocated decreased by the number of items shipped.

**Example:** Two boxes of shoes from warehouse A are shipped to a customer. The stock records **quantity** is now **3**, **quantity allocated** becomes **2** and **quantity available** stays at **1**.
